 * effect wants turbulence AND a cone burst AND ground-stop together, so a sealed preset would
 * either explode combinatorially or block real combos; small grouped value classes fix the
 * param-count bloat without that trade-off).
 *
 * Every particle spawns [spawnRadius] units from [ParticleEmitter.origin], on a random point
 * around a flat horizontal ring (`0f`, the default, spawns exactly at `origin`, unchanged from
 * before this field existed).
 *
 * Velocity resolution, in priority order:
 * 1. [convergeToOrigin] `true`: direction points from the spawn point back toward `origin`, at
 *    [baseVelocity]'s own speed -- combined with [spawnRadius] > 0, this is a "charging circle"
 *    (particles appear on a ring and converge inward), the classic cast/channel-spell VFX.
 * 2. [coneHalfAngleDegrees] set (and [baseVelocity] non-zero): direction randomized within that
 *    half-angle around [baseVelocity]'s own direction, at [baseVelocity]'s own speed -- a
 *    cone/fan burst. [velocityJitter] is ignored in this mode.
 * 3. Otherwise: [baseVelocity] plus independent per-axis [velocityJitter] -- a soft cloud.
 *
 * [turbulence] adds a smooth flow-field offset to velocity every frame, scaled by this strength
 * and sampled at [turbulenceFrequency] -- see [io.github.awakelab.awake.scene.rendering
 * .systems.turbulenceOffset]. `0f` (default) is a no-op. ponytail: a cheap sine-based flow

 * independent per-particle fade/tint -- something static instancing has no use for.

 * place (`origin.set(...)`) rather than reassigned to move an emitter -- e.g. tracking
 * [ParticleDynamics.followEntity]'s position every frame, or gameplay code calling
 * `emitter.origin.set(...)` directly for a spell that follows its caster.
 *
 * [maxParticles] bounds the pool -- [spawnRate] particles/second spawn into dead slots until
 * every slot is live, at which point spawning silently stops until a slot frees up (no
 * queueing, no overflow allocation). A particle lives for [lifetime] seconds, fades linearly
 * from [startAlpha] to 0 over its life -- no rotation is ever written into a particle's own
 * model matrix (billboarding is camera-facing math done entirely in `particle.wgsl`'s vertex
 * stage), so `ParticleSystem` only ever needs to build a translation+uniform-scale matrix per
 * particle, never a rotation.
 *
 * [motion]/[visual]/[ground]/[lifecycle]/[dynamics] group every optional capability by concern
 * -- see each type's own doc comment. All default to their own no-op shape, so a caller that
 * only needs the 8 required params above gets exactly the plain-jitter-cloud emitter this class
 * always built.
 *
 * [children] is a real parent/child emitter tree -- each child's own [origin] is treated as a
 * fixed LOCAL offset from this emitter's `origin` (never mutated), recomposed every frame by
 * [io.github.awakelab.awake.scene.rendering.systems.ParticleSystem] the same way
 * [ParticleDynamics.followEntity] recomposes THIS emitter's own origin from a followed
 * `Transform`. Unlike [ParticleDynamics.followEntity] (one emitter trailing one moving entity)
 * or [ParticleLifecycle.onParticleDeath] (a one-shot burst chained on death), a child here is a
 * CONTINUOUSLY co-simulated emitter riding along for this emitter's whole life -- a torch flame
 * with a child ember-spark emitter at its tip, both driven by one authored composition instead
 * of two separately-wired entities. Children have no `Entity`/`World` presence of their own --
 * they live and die with this emitter's own entity, simplest possible teardown. Empty (default)
 * is a leaf emitter, unchanged from before this field existed.
