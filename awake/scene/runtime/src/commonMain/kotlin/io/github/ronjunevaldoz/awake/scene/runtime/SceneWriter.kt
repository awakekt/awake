 * Expect/actual because there is no shared filesystem: the desktop target writes a real file, the
 * browser has none and hands the JSON to a download instead. Returning a string rather than
 * writing to a caller-chosen path keeps that difference honest -- "saved to ~/..." is a desktop
 * truth the web target cannot promise.
