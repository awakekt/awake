/**
 * A view + perspective-projection pair -- extracted out of `VulkanApplication`'s
 * `updateUniformBuffer` (previously computed inline, mixed in with the demo's own
 * cube-spin animation). Pure math, no GPU/backend dependency, so it lives in `awake-core`
 * rather than `awake-vulkan`: any future backend (WebGPU, Metal) needs the same view/
 * projection math, and testing it doesn't require a GPU.
 *
 * A `Camera` describes a **lens** -- eye, target, up, field of view, near/far -- and nothing
 * else. It deliberately stores no clip-space convention: the active
 * [io.github.ronjunevaldoz.awake.render.renderer.Renderer] owns that (it owns the API), and
 * passes its [ClipSpace] to [viewProjectionMatrix] at the moment the matrix is built. That is
 * why a scene, a demo or a test cannot bake in the wrong convention -- it never supplies one.
