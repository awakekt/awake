/**
 * Phase 1d Vulkan API surface generated via jni-binding-generator (vendored in
 * tools/jni-binding-generator), not the legacy awake-vulkan-generator that backs
 * io.github.ronjunevaldoz.awake.vulkan.Vulkan. Kept in a separate package/object
 * deliberately: the generateJniBindings Gradle task uses `--package-filter` scoped to
 * this package, so it never touches the legacy Vulkan.kt (which has several return/param
 * shapes jni-binding-generator doesn't support as *function-level* types yet, e.g.
 * `Array<VkLayerProperties>` as a return type — only as a struct *field*, which is what
 * Phase 1a's D10 fix actually added). See docs/decisions/D10-codegen-derisk-findings.md.
 *
 * `vkMapMemory`'s natural signature returns a raw pointer/`java.nio.ByteBuffer`, but
 * `java.nio` doesn't exist on Kotlin/Native — it can't be a commonMain `expect` type across
 * every platform. Instead of hand-writing a whole separate map/unmap object,
 * `writeBufferMemoryFloats` does map→memcpy→unmap as one call taking a plain `FloatArray`
 * (universal across every KMP target, and already in jni-binding-generator's supported-type
 * table) — a safer API besides (no manual unmap-forgetting lifecycle bug possible) and one
 * that still fits the auto-generated model with a hand-written native body, exactly like
 * `vkCreateBuffer`.
