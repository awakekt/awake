/**
 * The shadow depth pre-pass. NOT a [RenderFeature]: it begins and ends its own render pass
 * (the shadow map's, not the scene's) and runs on its own one-time command buffer before the
 * frame's command buffer is recorded at all, so it shares no signature with the shared-pass
 * features. Kept as a deliberate special case rather than generalized -- if a second
 * standalone-pass feature ever exists, that is the moment to look for a shared shape.
 *
 * Renders every [PreparedDrawCall] whose resolved pipeline shares the primary
 * [VertexFormat] (not just the literal primary pipeline object) from the light's point of view
 * into [shadowMap]. That also covers the instanced primary-format pipeline (same vertex layout,
 * just instanced) -- an instanced crowd casts a shadow like its non-instanced counterpart.
 * Still does NOT cover skinned-instanced or particle draws: [shadowRenderPipeline] is built
 * with ONE fixed vertex layout, and those use a genuinely different one it cannot correctly
 * bind -- extending coverage to them needs a shadow pipeline per format, not a wider check.
 *
 * Binds each [PreparedDrawCall.material]'s own descriptor set (already written with `lightMvp`
 * by `prepareDrawCalls`) against [shadowRenderPipeline]'s layout instead of a second per-draw
 * uniform scheme -- see that pipeline's own doc comment for why the two layouts are
 * binding-compatible.
