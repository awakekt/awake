 * Two unrelated cases share this type, matching the shared `Renderer.createMaterial` contract:
 * a UI-compositing material ([createResourcesFromRenderTarget], sampled by
 * [io.github.ronjunevaldoz.awake.webgpu.ui.UiTextureRenderPipeline], which owns its own bind
 * groups) and a 3D `DrawCall.material` with a real base-color texture ([createResources]),
 * which owns the uniform buffer + bind group `textured.wgsl` declares.
 *
 * Unlike Vulkan's descriptor set (host-side writable, so one set can be rewritten per draw),
 * a `GPUBindGroup` is immutable once created -- so [bindGroup] is built once, lazily, against
 * the pipeline this material is first drawn through.
