/**
 * Phase 2.5 milestone 2 slice 1 (see docs/MVP_PLAN.md): real wgpu4k implementation.
 *
 * Unlike the other three platforms, [create]'s [window] parameter here is a pre-resolved
 * [WGPUContext], not a raw canvas -- `canvasContextRenderer()`/`Surface.configure()` are
 * `suspend`, and `kotlinx.coroutines.runBlocking` does not exist on `wasmJs` at all (a
 * single-threaded JS event loop can't block), confirmed the hard way (the import itself
 * doesn't resolve). `create()` on the `expect` contract is not `suspend`, so the async
 * device/surface acquisition has to happen *before* this is called -- the caller resolves
 * a `WGPUContext` via `canvasContextRenderer()` + `surface.configure()` in its own
 * coroutine, then passes it here. This is the same "[window] means something different per
 * platform" pattern already in use (GLFW `Long` on desktop, `android.view.Surface` on
 * Android) -- `Any` was deliberately loose for exactly this kind of flexibility.
 *
 * [wgpuContext] is `internal`, not part of the `expect` contract -- only other wasmJsMain
 * actuals (RenderPipeline/Mesh/Renderer, all in this same source set) reach into it
 * directly, via [WebGpuHandles] for the individual object handles their own Long-typed
 * fields need.
