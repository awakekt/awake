 * The `expect` renderer seam (GraphicsDevice/Mesh/RenderPipeline/etc., see
 * docs/MVP_PLAN.md's Phase 2.5 section) types every handle as `Long`, mirroring Vulkan's
 * raw-integer-handle model -- but wgpu4k hands back real typed Kotlin objects (GPUDevice,
 * GPUBuffer, GPURenderPipeline, ...), not integers. This table assigns each such object an
 * incrementing Long id so the wasmJs actuals can satisfy the existing Long-typed contract
 * without changing it (a contract change would ripple back into commonMain and force
 * re-verification across the 4 already-proven platforms, for zero benefit to them).
 * wasmJsMain-internal only -- invisible to commonMain and every other platform.
