 * Auto/manual "time" driver for scrubbable per-frame animation -- shared shape any game/demo can
 * reuse, not coupled to what the time actually drives (rotation, orbit, a skinned-mesh clip).
 * [autoPlay] (default `true`) advances [hours] every [advance] call by real elapsed time; turning
 * it off freezes [hours] at whatever a slider bound to it last set, so a visual bug can be
 * inspected at an exact frame instead of chased through a live animation and a screenshot tool
 * with no frame-accurate timing.
 *
 * [hours] is a 0..24 "clock face" framing (arbitrary but readable) rather than a raw radian/
 * second value -- a caller maps it to whatever unit it actually needs (e.g.
 * `hours * (360f / HOURS_PER_CYCLE)` for a full-turn rotation).
