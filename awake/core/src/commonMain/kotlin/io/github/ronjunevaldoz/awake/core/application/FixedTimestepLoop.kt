/**
 * Decouples simulation from rendering: [advance] accumulates the variable, measured
 * per-frame [GameLoop] delta and drains it in fixed-size [fixedDelta] steps (calling
 * [FixedUpdate] once per step), then calls [Render] exactly once per frame regardless of
 * how many (including zero) fixed steps ran.
 *
 * This matters once simulation does velocity/force integration (physics, Phase 8) -- a
 * variable step size there makes the simulation's behavior depend on framerate (and can
 * destabilize spring/collision integrators entirely). It's a no-op simplification today:
 * [io.github.ronjunevaldoz.awake.scene.systems.TransformSystem] only recomputes matrices
 * from the current position/rotation/scale, it doesn't integrate anything, so it would be
 * correct either way. This class exists so that guarantee holds once something *does* need
 * it, without every call site having to know or care.
 *
 * Deliberately does not interpolate rendered state between the last two fixed steps (the
 * usual pairing for this pattern, using the leftover `accumulator / fixedDelta` fraction to
 * blend the last two simulation states) -- there are no stored "previous" component values
 * to blend from yet. [render]'s `alpha` parameter is provided for a future render system
 * that wants it; today's [io.github.ronjunevaldoz.awake.scene.systems.RenderSystem] ignores
 * it and just draws whatever [FixedUpdate] last wrote.
