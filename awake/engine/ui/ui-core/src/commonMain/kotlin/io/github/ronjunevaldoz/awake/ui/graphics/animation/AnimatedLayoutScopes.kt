    // on an epsilon "snapDistance" to decide when to give up and call it 0 -- decay is fastest
    // early and slows to an imperceptible crawl near the target, so in practice content looked
    // fully collapsed within ~15-20 frames while the container kept an invisible sliver of
    // leftover height for dozens more frames, then hard-snapped to exactly 0 once it finally
    // crossed the epsilon (reported live as "slowly hidden, then snap" -- a real, reproducible
    // symptom, not a one-off). Worse, since a wrap-sized parent (e.g. a card) measures this
    // child's height fresh every frame, the parent's own shrink desynced from the child's the
    // instant the child's slot went from "still claiming a sub-2px sliver" to "gone entirely" --
    // the parent had no equivalent snap of its own to stay in lockstep with (reported separately

    // the EXACT target in a known, bounded number of frames, so the slot legitimately becomes
    // exactly 0 (not epsilon-close) right as the tween completes, and a wrap-sized parent measuring
    // it every frame tracks that exact value with no separate snap step to fall out of sync.
