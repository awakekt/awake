/**
 * Compares our text rendering against the same TTF rendered by Chromium
 * (`tools/capture_font_reference.py`, references in `docs/reference/font-previews/`).
 *
 * Exists because atlas metrics alone could not answer whether a glyph sitting a pixel low was
 * faithful to the typeface or introduced by us. The control says introduced by us: real Roboto
 * puts every flat and round glyph on one row at 12, 14 and 16px, while our atlas splits them by
 * a pixel at 12 and 14. The drift is recorded below rather than asserted away, so it cannot
 * widen unnoticed and disappears from the map when the atlas is fixed.

     * were not real -- `ourSpread` called `rasterize()` without `font =`, measuring the
     * null-font placeholder rect instead of glyph sampling. Measured honestly (font passed,
     * coverage from alpha over a transparent background, half-coverage ink threshold) after
     * glyph quads were fixed to cover their full UV sample rect, all four samples split by
     * exactly one pixel: the round glyphs' designed baseline overshoot (~0.01em, sub-pixel)
     * can quantize their ink bottom one row below the flat glyphs'. Chromium's hinter snaps
     * that overshoot away; we render unhinted. */
