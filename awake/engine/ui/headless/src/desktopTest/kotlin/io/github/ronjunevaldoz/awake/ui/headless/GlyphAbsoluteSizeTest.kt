/**
 * Asserts rendered ink SIZE against the font's own metrics -- the absolute gate this repo never
 * had. Every other font gate is scale-invariant (baseline spread) or self-referential (snapshot
 * signatures, stem consistency), which is how glyphs could render at a fraction of their metrics
 * with every gate green: the 2026-08-10 "0.6x glyphs" investigation turned out to be exactly
 * that, a harness measuring the rasterizer's null-font placeholder rects while believing it
 * measured glyph sampling (docs/tasks/2026-08-10-glyph-scale-regression.md).
 *
 * 'H' is the measuring stick because capHeightEm is derived from its ink: flat top on the cap
 * line, flat bottom on the baseline, no overshoot. Its rendered ink height must therefore equal
 * capHeightEm * sizePx, and its width widthEm * sizePx, within a pixel of quantization. This
 * fails against the placeholder-rect path (which draws ~0.5-0.62x of the quad), so the gate also
 * guards the harness itself against ever silently losing its font again.
