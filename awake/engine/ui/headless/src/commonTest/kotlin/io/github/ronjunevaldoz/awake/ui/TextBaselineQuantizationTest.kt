/**
 * Guards the fix for visibly "wavy" text -- glyphs on one line sitting a pixel above or below
 * their neighbours.
 *
 * The cause was quantization shape, not font metrics. `Glyph(round(y), round(h))` renders a
 * bottom edge of `round(y) + round(h)`: two independent roundings of two different fractional
 * values. Glyphs resting on one baseline have different `offsetYEm`/`heightEm` (correctly --
 * 'S' and 'o' start at different ink heights), so those fractions differ and the pair of
 * roundings lands their bottoms up to a pixel apart. The baseline they share was never snapped
 * itself; it was re-derived per glyph from two separately-rounded numbers. `BasicText` now
 * rounds the right/bottom EDGES from the same unrounded origin, so glyphs on a common true
 * baseline round to a common bottom.
 *
 * Uses [VaryingMetricsFont] rather than `BitmapFont`: `BitmapFont.uvFor` returns a default
 * [GlyphRect], so every glyph has identical `offsetYEm`/`heightEm` and the defect is
 * arithmetically unreachable -- a BitmapFont version of this test passes against the *broken*
 * code too. That is open-risk 3 in docs/reference/ui-status.md (test font != app font) turning
 * a gate into a decoration, so the metrics that matter are declared here explicitly.
