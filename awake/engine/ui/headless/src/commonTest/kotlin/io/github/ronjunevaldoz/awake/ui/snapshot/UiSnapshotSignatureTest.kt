// 2026-08-03: PackedUiFont.advanceFor() now clamps the pen step to the glyph's own quad right
// edge (see PackedUiFont.kt) -- the embedded Roboto data declared several letters' advances up
// to 42% narrower than their own ink, which rendered as adjacent glyphs visibly touching/merging
// at real UI text sizes. Every text-bearing scene's rasterized pixels shifted as a result, so
// every signature below was re-recorded against the fixed, non-overlapping glyph spacing.
// 2026-08-08: re-recorded for two stacked intended changes: (1) text()'s verticallyCentered
// default flipped to true in ac03b490 without a re-record at the time; (2) the AA fringe now
// centers on the true path boundary (interior insets by fringe/2) instead of dilating outward,
// so every filled-path edge crisped by ~0.5px.
// 2026-08-08: re-recorded after em normalisation was corrected. Glyph metrics were divided by
// the line-height cell (19) rather than the render font size (16), so every advance and quad was
// 16/19 = 0.842x too small and all text rendered ~19% narrow. Text is now its true size, and
// slots size to the line box (lineHeightEm) instead of the font size so they can contain it.
// 2026-08-10 (5): re-recorded after UiRasterizer was made numerically equivalent to the real
// glyph shaders -- it had applied no stem darkening on either branch and resolved a distance
// field with a size-derived smoothstep instead of the shaders' screenPxRange. Until now these
// signatures described a renderer nobody ships.
// 2026-08-10 (4): pxrange 4 -> 2. A distance field cannot encode a feature thinner than its
// own spread, and at 4 (with an em spanning 32 texels) 'i'/'l' stems were narrower than the
// range and rendered eroded next to rounder glyphs.
// 2026-08-10 (3): re-recorded after the atlas became MTSDF -- msdfgen-generated, 4-channel,
// sampled via median3 instead of coverage alpha. Every glyph's pixels are now resolved from a
// distance field rather than a resampled bitmap, so all of them changed.
// 2026-08-10 (2): re-recorded again after the atlas moved to TTF outline geometry
// (:awake:engine:ui:font-atlas-generator) and BasicText switched to snapping a line's pen
// origin once with exact per-glyph sizes. Every glyph's position and size changed.
// 2026-08-10: re-recorded after BasicText switched from rounding each glyph's origin and size
// independently to rounding its right/bottom edges from one unrounded origin -- the "wavy text"
// fix. Every text-bearing scene moved by up to a pixel per glyph.

// 2026-08-03: quads/rounded-quads/borders (surface fills, buttons, dialogs, separators) now
// pixel-snap their emitted position/size the same way BasicText.kt's glyph emission already
// did (see ShapePainter.kt/BorderPrimitives.kt/Separator.kt) -- previously only glyphs snapped
// to whole device pixels, so a bordered/panel-shaped widget at a sub-pixel layout position
// rendered a visibly softer/antialiased edge than the crisp text sitting right next to it.
// Every scene with a border/panel/button shifted its rasterized pixels by sub-pixel rounding as
// a result; re-recorded against the now-pixel-snapped primitives.
// 2026-08-08: re-recorded again after the shadcn token/radius value pass (base radius 6->10dp,
// additive radius scale, button/input rounded-md, accent/muted/sidebar-primary colors) -- every
// tutorial scene renders through ShadcnTheme, so all of them shifted.
// 2026-08-08: re-recorded once more after the glyph-advance coordinate-space fix -- advances
// were inflated by the atlas cell padding by a per-glyph-varying 6-29%, so every glyph in every
// text-bearing scene moved.
// 2026-08-08: ui-component-state-matrix only -- the checkbox corner moved off radii.md (8dp on a
// 16dp box, i.e. a circle) to shadcn's literal rounded-[4px]. It is the one scene with a checkbox.
// 2026-08-08: ui-component-state-matrix again -- the slider knob shrank 20dp -> 16dp with a 1dp
// border, shadcn v4's size-4 thumb. It is also the one scene with a slider.
// 2026-08-11: re-recorded (both maps) after glyph render quads were widened to cover their full
// UV sample rect (outline + crop bleed + texel snap, see PackedUiFontData.quadMetricsEm). Ink
// previously rendered at ~0.90x of its own metrics because the padded atlas region was squeezed
// into an outline-sized quad; every text-bearing scene's pixels moved when that closed.
