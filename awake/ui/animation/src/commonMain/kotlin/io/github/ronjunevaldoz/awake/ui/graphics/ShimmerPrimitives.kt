/**
 * Real shadcn-compose's shimmer uses GPU offscreen compositing (Offscreen graphicsLayer +
 * BlendMode.SrcAtop) so it works over ANY already-drawn content without knowing its shape in
 * advance. Awake has no offscreen-render-target/blend-mode primitive on either backend yet, so
 * this is a clip-based workaround: it needs the shape declared upfront (shapeSpec/radiusPx), and
 * can't shimmer arbitrary content like an icon glyph. Fine for skeletons/cards/avatars (shape is
 * always known). Follow-up: add a real offscreen-render-target + SrcAtop-blend primitive on both
 * backends, ported from Modifier.shimmer's actual mechanism, if arbitrary-content shimmer is ever
 * needed.
