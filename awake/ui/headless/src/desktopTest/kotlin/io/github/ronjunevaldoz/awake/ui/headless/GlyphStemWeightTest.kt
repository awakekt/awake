/**
 * Asserts that repeating one glyph renders it at the same weight every time.
 *
 * This exists because nothing else we own could see the defect it guards. Baseline fidelity
 * measures vertical ink-bottom spread; snapshot signatures only assert "pixels match what was
 * last recorded", which they do just as happily for wrong pixels as right ones. Both were green
 * through two separate rounds of visibly uneven text, and each round was caught by a person
 * looking at the screen instead.
 *
 * The measurement is deliberately narrow: the SAME character, drawn repeatedly on one line, must
 * have identical rendered stem width at each instance. Same glyph means same UV window, same
 * metrics and same scale, so any variance can only come from where the quad lands -- sub-pixel
 * phase as fractional advances accumulate, or from a quad whose size was rounded independently
 * of its scale. Both are real defects this repo shipped:
 *
 *  - Rounding each glyph's edges made a glyph's SIZE vary, so a fixed UV window resampled into
 *    differently-sized quads drew the same stroke at different weights.
 *  - A coverage atlas resolved phase differently per instance, so a 1px stem straddling two
 *    texels rendered as two half-lit pixels in one place and one solid pixel in another.
 *
 * MTSDF resolves the edge analytically per pixel, which is what makes this assertion holdable.
