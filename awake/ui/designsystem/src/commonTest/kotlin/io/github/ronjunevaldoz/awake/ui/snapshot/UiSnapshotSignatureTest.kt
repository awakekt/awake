// 2026-08-03: PackedUiFont.advanceFor() now clamps the pen step to the glyph's own quad right
// edge (see PackedUiFont.kt) -- the embedded Roboto data declared several letters' advances up
// to 42% narrower than their own ink, which rendered as adjacent glyphs visibly touching/merging
// at real UI text sizes. Every text-bearing scene's rasterized pixels shifted as a result, so
// every signature below was re-recorded against the fixed, non-overlapping glyph spacing.
// 2026-08-08: re-recorded for two stacked intended changes: (1) text()'s verticallyCentered
// default flipped to true in ac03b490 without a re-record at the time; (2) the AA fringe now
// centers on the true path boundary (interior insets by fringe/2) instead of dilating outward,
// so every filled-path edge crisped by ~0.5px.
// 2026-08-08: re-recorded after em normalisation was corrected. Glyph metrics were divided by
// the line-height cell (19) rather than the render font size (16), so every advance and quad was
// 16/19 = 0.842x too small and all text rendered ~19% narrow. Text is now its true size, and
// slots size to the line box (lineHeightEm) instead of the font size so they can contain it.
// 2026-08-10 (5): re-recorded after UiRasterizer was made numerically equivalent to the real
// glyph shaders -- it had applied no stem darkening on either branch and resolved a distance
// field with a size-derived smoothstep instead of the shaders' screenPxRange. Until now these
// signatures described a renderer nobody ships.
// 2026-08-10 (4): pxrange 4 -> 2. A distance field cannot encode a feature thinner than its
// own spread, and at 4 (with an em spanning 32 texels) 'i'/'l' stems were narrower than the
// range and rendered eroded next to rounder glyphs.
// 2026-08-10 (3): re-recorded after the atlas became MTSDF -- msdfgen-generated, 4-channel,
// sampled via median3 instead of coverage alpha. Every glyph's pixels are now resolved from a
// distance field rather than a resampled bitmap, so all of them changed.
// 2026-08-10 (2): re-recorded again after the atlas moved to TTF outline geometry
// (:awake:ui:font-atlas-generator) and BasicText switched to snapping a line's pen
// origin once with exact per-glyph sizes. Every glyph's position and size changed.
// 2026-08-10: re-recorded after BasicText switched from rounding each glyph's origin and size
// independently to rounding its right/bottom edges from one unrounded origin -- the "wavy text"
// fix. Every text-bearing scene moved by up to a pixel per glyph.
// 2026-08-16: review fixtures now render through renderUiComponent and install Shadcn through
// rootProvider. The changed scenes previously depended on Core defaults; existing Shadcn scenes
// remain byte-identical.
// 2026-08-17 (2): `ui-panel-controls` re-recorded after the shadcnField* helpers were fixed to
// wrap label+widget in the shadcnField{} container instead of emitting loose siblings into the
// caller's scope (package 3 / F7 in docs/audits/2026-08-17-ui-refactor-vs-recreate-audit.md).
// Every field group in the scene shifts down; render reviewed by eye before re-pinning.
// 2026-08-17: re-recorded after UiComponentStyles/theme.components was retired (the ambient
// theme-fallback registry ui-headless used to read for its own "default style" -- see
// docs/audits/ for the full removal). `toggle-unchecked`/`toggle-checked`/`button-filled`/
// `button-outline`/`button-ghost`/`theme-dark`/`theme-light`/`panel-with-children` all call the
// bare Headless primitive (`toggle()`/`button()`/`checkbox()`) directly with no `style`, exactly
// the ambient-fallback-reliant shape this removal targeted -- they now render with no color at
// all (several button variants are now pixel-identical, having lost their only differentiator),
// which is the CORRECT, intended consequence: ui-headless no longer supplies one, and these
// fixtures never asked a design-system layer (shadcnButton/shadcnToggle/shadcnCheckbox) to. Every
// real branded (shadcn*) scene is unaffected (its recipe's Style was already complete).
// `shadcn-field-error` is untouched.

// 2026-08-03: quads/rounded-quads/borders (surface fills, buttons, dialogs, separators) now
// pixel-snap their emitted position/size the same way BasicText.kt's glyph emission already
// did (see ShapePainter.kt/BorderPrimitives.kt/Separator.kt) -- previously only glyphs snapped
// to whole device pixels, so a bordered/panel-shaped widget at a sub-pixel layout position
// rendered a visibly softer/antialiased edge than the crisp text sitting right next to it.
// Every scene with a border/panel/button shifted its rasterized pixels by sub-pixel rounding as
// a result; re-recorded against the now-pixel-snapped primitives.
// 2026-08-08: re-recorded again after the shadcn token/radius value pass (base radius 6->10dp,
// additive radius scale, button/input rounded-md, accent/muted/sidebar-primary colors) -- every
// tutorial scene renders through ShadcnTheme, so all of them shifted.
// 2026-08-08: re-recorded once more after the glyph-advance coordinate-space fix -- advances
// were inflated by the atlas cell padding by a per-glyph-varying 6-29%, so every glyph in every
// text-bearing scene moved.
// 2026-08-08: ui-component-state-matrix only -- the checkbox corner moved off radii.md (8dp on a
// 16dp box, i.e. a circle) to shadcn's literal rounded-[4px]. It is the one scene with a checkbox.
// 2026-08-08: ui-component-state-matrix again -- the slider knob shrank 20dp -> 16dp with a 1dp
// border, shadcn v4's size-4 thumb. It is also the one scene with a slider.
// 2026-08-11: re-recorded (both maps) after glyph render quads were widened to cover their full
// UV sample rect (outline + crop bleed + texel snap, see PackedUiFontData.quadMetricsEm). Ink
// previously rendered at ~0.90x of its own metrics because the padded atlas region was squeezed
// into an outline-sized quad; every text-bearing scene's pixels moved when that closed.
// 2026-08-12: re-recorded after the tutorial/review fixture migrated its public component scenes
// from the temporary Core-receiver compatibility bridge to the Compose-style Headless facade.
// 2026-08-13: re-recorded after supportingText unified with shadcnMuted typography token.
// 2026-08-15: ui-component-state-matrix only -- focused text fields now border in
// theme.colors.ring instead of reusing the unfocused border color at a thicker width, matching
// upstream's focus-visible:border-ring. It is the one scene with a focused field.
// 2026-08-16: ui-component-state-matrix only -- Headless controls now apply generic Style
// directly after the legacy visual-data contract removal. The fixture deliberately calls the
// unskinned Headless controls, so it no longer inherits the old Core component visual fallback.
// 2026-08-17: re-recorded after UiComponentStyles/theme.components was retired -- see the
// matching review-map comment above for the full reasoning. `ui-component-state-matrix` calls
// bare `toggle()`/`checkbox()`/`slider()`/`textField()` with no `style`, so it loses their
// ambient-fallback coloring the same way the review scenes do. `ui-shaped-panel` calls the raw
// `surface()` primitive with a style that sets shape/border/contentPadding but not background --
// it used to inherit Shadcn's own card background/foreground for the unset fields from the
// ambient default; ui-core's replacement default is deliberately theme-neutral (see
// `neutralSurfaceDefaults`'s doc in `layouts/Surface.kt` -- ui-core cannot reach into
// ui-designsystem for a themed color), so this one scene now renders Core's neutral gray instead
// of Shadcn's card color where it left a field unset. Every scene built from shadcn* recipes
// (ui-button-variants/ui-panel-controls/ui-alert-dialog/ui-rounded-clip-vector/
// ui-awake-shadcn-showcase) is unaffected, having always supplied a complete Style.
