/**
 * Applies a shadcn theme to everything drawn inside the block.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * ui.shadcnTheme(dark = true) {
 *     drawApp()
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The scoped reading of the same theme the factory already produced. `pushTheme`/`popTheme` still
 * work and this is a thin wrapper over them -- the value is that the pair cannot come apart: the
 * pop runs in a `finally`, so content that throws does not leave its theme applied to every widget
 * drawn after it in the frame.
 *
 * This is Awake's answer to `CompositionLocalProvider(LocalTheme provides x) { }`, and the
 * resemblance is real -- a value scoped to a subtree, read by descendants, restored on the way out.
 * The machinery underneath is not Compose's: there is no composition and no recomposition, just a
 * stack pushed and popped as the immediate-mode frame is built. So a block reads the same, while
 * `setContent { App() }` does not transfer -- the runtime drives the frame and calls the UI, rather
 * than a composition owning it.
