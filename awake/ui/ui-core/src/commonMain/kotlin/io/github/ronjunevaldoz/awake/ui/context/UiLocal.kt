/**
 * A value that scopes to a subtree: provide it on the way in, read it anywhere below, and it is
 * restored on the way out. Awake's equivalent of a Compose `CompositionLocal`.
 *
 * Compose splits this into `compositionLocalOf` and `staticCompositionLocalOf`, and that split
 * exists purely to decide whether reading one invalidates a composition scope. This engine rebuilds
 * every frame from scratch -- there is no composition, nothing to invalidate, no subtree to
 * selectively recompose -- so both collapse into this one type. Shipping the pair would mean
 * shipping a distinction with no observable difference.
 *
 * [combine] is what a straight port would not have. A scoped value is not always "replace the
 * parent": a text style MERGES with the one it nests inside, and alpha MULTIPLIES so nested layers
 * compound. A provider that only replaced would silently stop text inheriting and stop alpha
 * compounding, both of which read as a rendering bug far from the cause. The rule travels with the
 * value rather than living at each call site.
 *
 * Locals are declared once at file scope, so [slot] is handed out before the first frame and reads
 * are an array index rather than a hash lookup.
