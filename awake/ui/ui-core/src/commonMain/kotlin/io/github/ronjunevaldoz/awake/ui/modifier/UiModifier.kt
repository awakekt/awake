/**
 * Per-widget-call structural override only -- width/height are layout concerns, while fill,
 * shape, border, text scale, and padding now belong to [Style]. That keeps this type closer
 * to real Compose's "modifier is structure/behavior, style is visuals" split, which matters
 * once consumer-authored widgets and composite containers start reusing the same style stack
 * as built-ins.
 *
 * [widthDimension]/[heightDimension] are deliberately not named `width`/`height` -- those
 * names collide with the `UiModifier.width()`/`.height()` builder extension functions in
 * LayoutModifiers.kt, which used to make the Kotlin compiler misresolve chained calls like
 * `modifier.align(...).width(...)` on non-trivial receivers (a bogus type-inference ambiguity
 * error). See docs/reference/ui-ownership.md's modifier-first Hard Rule. Other fields below
 * (forceHover/forceActive/forceFocus/testTag/styleable/graphicsLayer) share a same-named
 * builder function too and carry the same latent risk, but haven't been confirmed to trigger
 * it -- not renamed here to avoid renaming on a guess.
 *
 * [layoutWeight] is likewise not named `weight` for the same reason -- [io.github.ronjunevaldoz.awake.ui.modifier.weight]
 * is the builder extension function name in LayoutModifiers.kt.
