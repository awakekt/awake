# UI refactor plan — 2026-08-17

**Verdict: refactor in place. Do not recreate.** Recreate only 3 small units
(`shadcnEmpty`, `shadcnTabs`, `ShadcnComponentStyles`, ~170 lines total) plus ~800 lines
of pure dead-code deletion.

Source: four parallel audits (ui-core, headless, designsystem, cross-cutting) over
`awake/ui/*`. Full evidence matrix in the [appendix](#appendix--full-findings-matrix);
each package below references its rows (A1, B2, …).

**Freshness (verified against HEAD `1cc85482`, 2026-08-17):** that commit ("retire
UiComponentStyles, kill headless's ambient theme fallback") pre-completed part of
package 4 — the `UiComponentStyles`/`CoreUiComponentStyles` defaults tier and
`theme.components.*` reads are already deleted (survivors are comments), and F5 +
the E5 scratch test are already gone. Some audit line numbers for that file family
came from stale `build/` mirrors; re-verify file:line before starting any row, and
exclude `**/build/**` from audit greps.

## Re-audit — 2026-08-20

Four fresh parallel audits (ui-core, headless, designsystem, cross-cutting) against
real current source, 3 days and ~30 commits after the original. Same method as the
2026-08-17 audit, same verdict: **refactor in place, don't recreate — holds more
strongly now than on 2026-08-17.** 603/603 real UI tests green (up from the 524
baseline cited as non-transferable "recreate" cost), `verifyUiOwnership` confirmed
still doing real work (hand-verified its exemption ledger matches the tree exactly,
not a vacuous green). No new architectural or layering problems found; only doc
drift (fixed above — Package 5 and B6 were fully landed but still shown unchecked)
and a set of small, bounded, mechanical-to-medium new findings:

- **designsystem** — 8 `public` style-fn functions have zero external callers, should
  be `internal` (`ShadcnAvatarStyles.kt`, `ShadcnSelectionStyles.kt`,
  `ShadcnStatusStyles.kt`, `ShadcnToastStyles.kt` — this is the original audit's own
  "8 unexplained public style fns" claim, never previously investigated, now
  confirmed real). 4 real id-default collision bugs, same class as the already-fixed
  F2 tooltip bug: `shadcnAvatarBadge`/`shadcnAvatarGroup`/`shadcnFieldSeparator`/
  `shadcnSidebarMenuSub` each string-interpolate a defaulted `id` into a *different*
  child widget's required-id slot — two un-ided sibling instances on one screen
  silently share a `WidgetState`/measure-cache bucket. `docs/reference/ui-status.md`
  risk #1 ("Button missing `px-4`") is stale — already fixed (`ShadcnButtonStyles.kt`
  sets `contentPadding` correctly), doc not updated.

  **Landed, 2026-08-20 (same day, follow-up pass) — 8 public style-fn finding only.**
  Re-grepped the whole repo (not just `awake/ui/shadcn`) for each of the 8 names
  and confirmed zero external callers again — every call site is inside
  `awake/ui/shadcn/src/commonMain/.../components/*Recipes.kt` (or `ShadcnToast.kt`),
  i.e. the same module. Changed all 8 from implicit-public to `internal`:
  `ShadcnAvatarStyles.kt`'s `shadcnAvatarStyle`/`shadcnAvatarBadgeStyle`,
  `ShadcnSelectionStyles.kt`'s `shadcnToggleGroupItemStyle`/`shadcnRadioStyle`,
  `ShadcnStatusStyles.kt`'s `shadcnProgressStyle`/`shadcnSkeletonStyle`/`shadcnSpinnerStyle`,
  `ShadcnToastStyles.kt`'s `shadcnToastStyle`. `:awake:ui:shadcn:desktopTest` and
  `:verifyUiOwnership` green; `:samples:ui-showcase:compileKotlinDesktop` and
  `:samples:studio:compileKotlinDesktop` both green, confirming no external code relied
  on the public visibility. The 4 id-default collision bugs and the stale
  `docs/reference/ui-status.md` risk #1 in this same bullet are unchanged, still open.
- **headless** — `popup()` still has a nullable/defaulted `id` (`Popup.kt:64`), the
  exact bug class F2 fixed for tooltip, one layer lower and still open; `popup()`
  also takes no `modifier` param at all — literally the root cause C6 already
  diagnosed for designsystem's 9 overlay wrappers.
  **Fixed 2026-08-20 (follow-up pass), C6 closed.** Investigation found the actual
  gap was one layer higher than C6's own framing suggested: `UiPrimitiveScope.popup()`
  in `ui-animation`'s `UiPopup.kt` already took a `modifier: UiModifier` param and
  already clamped its resolved size against `modifier.min/maxWidth/Height` (from an
  earlier pass, `2d0f4617b`) — the primitive was never the missing piece. The real
  gap was the `ui-headless` facades `popup()` (`Popup.kt`) and `dialog()` (`Dialog.kt`,
  which every dialog/drawer/alert-dialog wrapper routes through instead of `popup()`
  directly) always forwarding a bare `Modifier` instead of exposing one. Both now take
  `modifier: UiModifier = Modifier` and forward it. Design decision made:
  `width`/`height: Dimension` still pick the popup's base size (`Fixed` pins it,
  `FillMax`/`WrapContent` measure it, unchanged); `modifier`'s `widthIn(max=)`/
  `heightIn(max=)` only add a cap on top, matching the primitive's pre-existing
  `.constrain(min, max)` semantics — no new precedence logic needed, just plumbing.
  All 9 designsystem overlay wrappers (`shadcnDropdownMenu`, `shadcnTooltip`,
  `shadcnTooltipText`, `shadcnAlertDialog` ×2, `shadcnContextMenu`, `shadcnSheet`,
  `shadcnDrawer`, `shadcnDialog`) now accept and forward a real `modifier` param;
  none deferred, all were mechanical once the headless-layer plumbing existed. Also
  closes `docs/reference/ui-status.md` risk #7 (was misdiagnosed as a primitive-level
  gap; corrected). `id` still defaulted at `Popup.kt:64` — that bug is unrelated and
  stays open. 4 widgets
  (`rangeSlider`/`toast`/`toggleGroup`/`select`) still have only internal-level test
  coverage despite having a public facade that differs in signature — package 2's
  "17 new facade tests… all public `headless.*` imports" claim overclaims for these
  four.

  **Fixed 2026-08-20 (follow-up pass).** Re-checked current source for all four
  before writing anything: `rangeSlider()`, `toast()`, and both `toggleGroup()`
  overloads each still have a public `UiScope` facade (`Input.kt`, `Status.kt`,
  `Selection.kt`) with a real surface difference from their `UiPrimitiveScope`
  counterpart (different receiver reached without `primitive.context.createAbsolute`/
  `createColumn`, callback-based state for `toggleGroup` vs. the internal layer's
  bare primitive call). `select()` turned out to already be fixed — `SelectFacadeTest.kt`
  landed in an earlier commit on this branch (`ad76757ac`) and already drives the
  public `headless.select` facade end-to-end (trigger render → open → click an
  option); `UiPopupTest.kt`'s `dropdownUsesSharedPopupAndClosesAfterPickingOption()`
  still imports `headless.internal.controls.select` directly, but that's the
  internal-level test coexisting with the facade one, not a gap. Added 3 new files,
  6 new tests, all driving only `io.github.awakelab.awake.ui.headless.*`
  imports: `RangeSliderFacadeTest.kt` (bounds from the requested modifier; dragging
  near the end knob raises `valueEnd` only), `ToastFacadeTest.kt` (semantic node
  carries the message while visible; return value flips to `false` once `durationMs`
  elapses), `ToggleGroupFacadeTest.kt` (single-select overload's `onIndexChange` and
  multi-select overload's `onSelectedIndicesChange` both fire correctly on a click).
  `RangeSliderTest.kt`, `ToastTest.kt`, and `ToggleGroupWidgetTest.kt` (the
  internal-level tests) are untouched — they cover the lower `UiPrimitiveScope` layer
  and stay alongside the new facade tests, same as `ToggleFacadeTest.kt` sits
  alongside `ToggleGroupWidgetTest.kt` already. `:awake:ui:headless:desktopTest`
  (172 tests, 0 failures) and `:awake:ui:headless:verifyUiOwnership` both green.

  `checkbox`/`switch`/`toggle`/`toggleGroup` have no slot/content form (icon
  next to a label is impossible), unchanged and still open. C9's real remaining scope is narrower than
  documented: 6 of 7 widgets it worries about are already pure return-value with no
  callback; only `toggle` (dual return+callback) and `toggleGroup` (`Unit`+callback
  only) still need work.
- **ui-core** — two dead `@Deprecated` typealiases (`Dimension`/`LayoutWeight` in
  `layout/Dimension.kt`) with zero real importers, safe to delete. `CanvasScope`'s
  new `draw*` helpers (landed 2026-08-19) have no direct `ui-core` unit test, only
  indirect coverage through consumer-module snapshots.
- **Cross-cutting — the real headline finding.** `verifyUiOwnership` never runs on
  `samples:*` (not in `classifiedUiModules`), and this let real drift accumulate
  silently in exactly the layer nothing was watching: **~45 files** across
  `samples/studio` and `samples/ui-showcase` bypass `ui-headless`'s licensed
  `ModifierExports.kt` door and import `io.github.awakelab.awake.ui.modifier.*`
  (`ui-core`) directly — essentially every `ui-showcase` page file, plus 5 studio UI
  files. More severe: **3 confirmed instances of consumer code hand-authoring
  `Style { ... }`** against raw `surface()`/`text()` calls instead of using a
  `shadcn*` recipe — `StudioToolbar.kt:165` (`barBand()`), `IconRail.kt:42`
  (`railCard()`), `GettingStartedContent.kt:146` (`themeLabel()`, also reaching the
  raw ambient `primitive.theme` directly). This is a direct violation of the
  consumer rule codified 2 days ago in `docs/reference/ui-ownership.md`'s
  "Consuming From A Sample, Game, Or Tool" section — invisible until this audit
  because samples were never brought under the check that would have caught it.
  Confirms the original audit's own root-cause finding ("dirt accumulates because
  guardrails are off, not because the architecture is wrong") in a new place.
  B9b's designsystem-`api(ui-core)`-instead-of-`implementation` gap is confirmed
  still real but **should not be fixed before the ~45-file import drift and 3
  `Style{}` violations above are fixed** — flipping the dependency scope first would
  just break the build on those violations rather than resolve them. Real fix order:
  (1) repoint the ~45 imports (mechanical, sed-able), (2) fix or promote the 3
  `Style{}` sites to real recipes, (3) then flip designsystem's dependency scope and
  bring `samples:*` under `verifyUiOwnership`.

  **Landed, 2026-08-20 (same day, follow-up pass).** Real counts verified against
  source before touching anything: 40 files (35 `ui-showcase` + 5 `studio`), not
  ~45 — the audit's estimate rounds up; 3 `Style{}` sites confirmed exactly as
  described. **Step 1**: found one real gap in `ModifierExports.kt` before
  sweeping — `heightIn` exists in `ui-core`'s `LayoutModifiers.kt` and one file
  (`ShowcaseShell.kt`) used it, but the door didn't re-export it (only `widthIn`
  was). Added the re-export first, then repointed all 40 files' imports from
  `ui.modifier.*` to `ui.headless.*` (mechanical `sed`, zero manual edits,
  zero duplicate-import collisions). **Step 2**: `StudioToolbar.kt`'s `barBand()`
  and `IconRail.kt`'s `railCard()` were both a real, reusable shape (full-bleed
  muted chrome band; a card look with tighter padding) neither existing
  `ShadcnSurfaceVariant` covered — promoted both into `ui-shadcn`: a new
  `ShadcnSurfaceVariant.Band` (square corners, muted, horizontal-only inset,
  backed by a new `ShadcnMetrics.bandPaddingX` field defaulted to
  `fieldPaddingX` so the 8 existing theme presets need no per-theme tuning), and
  a `contentPadding: Dp? = null` override param on `shadcnSurface` for the
  card-with-tighter-padding case. `GettingStartedContent.kt`'s `themeLabel()`
  turned out to already have a matching recipe in the tree —
  `shadcnFieldLabel()` (`ShadcnFieldRecipes.kt`) resolves the identical
  foreground/typography.label pairing through `themeValues.typography.label`
  (accessible on the `ShadcnThemeValues` wrapper, not just raw `primitive.theme`)
  — swapped the hand-authored `Style{}` for a direct call, no new recipe needed.
  **Step 3**: flipped `implementation` (was `api`) and verified with a
  `--no-build-cache` clean compile (build-cache `FROM-CACHE` hits initially
  masked whether the flip mattered at all). Confirmed safe by construction, not
  just by a green build: grepped every real consumer of
  `:awake:ui:shadcn` (`samples:studio`, `samples:ui-showcase`,
  `awake:backend:vulkan` — the only 3 in the repo) and all three already declare
  their own direct `implementation(project(":awake:ui:ui-core"))`, so none were
  ever relying on designsystem's `api` re-export for their own compile
  classpath; the 3 real public designsystem signatures that take `Style` as a
  parameter (`shadcnResizableHandle`, `shadcnAlertDialog` ×2) still resolve
  fine for every current caller. Added `:samples:ui-showcase`/`:samples:studio`
  to `classifiedUiModules` and gave both a real (non-empty) rule set — banning
  `ui.modifier.*` imports and `Style {` authoring via `forbiddenUiSourcePatterns`
  — rather than the vacuous-empty-ruleset shape package 1's own root-cause
  finding warns against; both already applied `awake.ui-ownership-convention`
  and passed clean on the first run (no plugin was wired in for either sample
  before this pass). All verification green: the 6-module desktopTest command
  from this doc's own "Validation" line, `verifyUiOwnership` on all 5 UI
  modules plus both samples, and `awake:backend:vulkan:compileKotlinDesktop`
  (the third designsystem consumer, not in the mandated command but checked
  since it's the only other real caller).

None of the above changes the verdict. All are bounded, independently landable,
same shape as everything else that's already shipped from this doc — not
architectural surprises, not a case for recreate.

## TL;DR

- **The dirt accumulated because the guardrails were off, not because the architecture
  is wrong.** `verifyUiOwnership` has been a green no-op for headless + designsystem
  since a module rename (path typo in build-logic). ~54 violations piled up unseen.
- **Nothing scored complexity 5.** Every finding is a deletion, rename, Gradle string,
  or bounded sweep. The measure pass, `Style` resolver, and `UiLocal` machinery are
  sound and carry the project's best test coverage.
- **Recreate burns 524 tests + 89 goldens + the real-browser CSS oracle + the OKLCH
  token pipeline** — none of it transfers — then rebuilds the same workarounds against
  the same missing primitives.
- Effort: **~3–4 focused weeks across 6 packages, in order.** Each unblocks the next.
  Packages 1–3 ≈ one week, all low risk.

## Expected end state

What the stack looks like when all 6 packages land:

1. **One style channel.** Every visual property on every widget is set through
   `style: Style` and nowhere else. A variant is one `Style` value with state blocks
   (`hovered {}`, `selected {}`, `disabled {}`). The merge-order bug class (the
   2026-08-15 P0) is structurally impossible, not patched.
2. **One widget contract.** Every leaf widget:
   `(id, <state>, modifier, style, enabled, <callbacks>, content): Rectangle`.
   Learn one widget, know all of them. No sizing/spacing params — `Modifier` and
   `Style` own that, always.
3. **Single-responsibility leaves.** headless = leaf behavior only (dead composites
   deleted, live ones either moved or justified); designsystem wrapper = variant→Style
   mapping only, zero structural logic. Exactly one implementation per component.
4. **Layout without hacks.** Wrap-content parents size correctly around fillMax
   children; button group / toggle group are plain `row`/`column` with per-corner
   radii; the 4 workaround species are deleted.
5. **Guardrails that fire.** `verifyUiOwnership` and the designsystem audits actually
   run and fail on violations; unclassified modules break the build; the ownership doc
   describes the real module set. Dirt of every class found here cannot silently regrow.
6. **Tests guard the public API.** Facade-level widget tests + a style-precedence test
   gate every future sweep; goldens stop being Awake-vs-Awake tautologies.
7. **Smaller codebase.** ~800 lines dead code out, plus dedupe (Row ×5, 14 style
   re-impls, sidebar pair, icon registry) — net commonMain shrinks roughly 10–15%
   while behavior is preserved or fixed.
8. **Bug classes retired structurally:** merge-order colors, widget-id collisions,
   half-px seams (one `pixelPerfectPixel`), tooltip shared-state instability,
   trial-pass state corruption.

Not in scope of the 6 packages (parking lot): facade-mirror deletion, package-root
rename, typed px space, density globals, parity features (focus ring, popover panel,
checkmark, arrow). Those start from clean ground afterwards.

Snippet convention: `before` = in the tree today (file:line real). `after` = proposed
shape, not applied code.

## Package 1 — guardrails on (1 day) · rows A1 A2 A3

Everything else is only safe once the checks actually run.

- [x] Fix the 3 module-path literals in `build-logic/awake.ui-ownership-convention.gradle.kts`
- [x] Make unclassified modules fail instead of falling to `emptyList()` (`classifiedUiModules` guard)
- [x] ~~Wire `auditUiShadcnHeadlessBoundary` into `check`~~ — deleted instead: its rules
      moved into `verifyUiOwnership` (which is in `check`); one rule source, not two
- [x] Key `auditUiShadcnRecipeDuplicates` by file, not package — immediately caught the
      `shadcnEmpty` twin (B8), which was merged on the spot: `ShadcnEmptyRecipes.kt` +
      `ShadcnEmptyStyles.kt` deleted, `InspectorPanel.kt` migrated to the id-form; compile
      verified across designsystem/studio/ui-showcase
- [x] Delete `reportUiShadcnMigrationProgress` and the inverted `verifyUiShadcnClasspath`;
      also deleted the fragile commonMain include-filter (component naming audit already owns that rule)
- [x] Triage the surfaced violations — outcome: contract imports (`ui.style`, `ui.theme`, `ui.font`)
      legalized per the ownership doc's own licensing; runtime packages + `primitive.context` banned;
      `UiLocal`/`uiLocalOf` allowed via lookahead; 2 known offenders on the shrink-only
      `exemptUiSourcePatternFiles` ledger (`ShadcnButtonGroupRecipes.kt`, `ShadcnThemeLocals.kt`);
      task gained `exemptSourcePatternFiles` support. All 5 UI modules green with rules live
- [x] Update `docs/reference/ui-ownership.md` (real task paths, exemption ledger, ui-api de-facto
      note, stale `.copy()` note corrected, root-file count) + `awake/ui/README.md` (2 stale lines)

```kotlin
// before — awake.ui-ownership-convention.gradle.kts:16
when (project.path) {
    ":awake:ui:ui-core"         -> listOf(coreRules)
    ":awake:ui:ui-headless"     -> listOf(headlessRules)   // real path is :awake:ui:headless — never matches
    ":awake:ui:ui-shadcn" -> listOf(dsRules)         // never matches either
    else -> emptyList()                                    // both land here: green no-op
}

// after
when (project.path) {
    ":awake:ui:ui-core"      -> listOf(coreRules)
    ":awake:ui:headless"     -> listOf(headlessRules)
    ":awake:ui:shadcn" -> listOf(dsRules)
    else -> error("unclassified UI module: ${project.path}")   // rename can't disarm it again
}
```

**Done when:** `verifyUiOwnership` fails on a deliberately-planted violation in headless
and designsystem; violation list triaged into follow-up items.

---

## Package 2 — safety net (1–2 days) · row F10

Headless tests drive `UiPrimitiveScope`; the `UiScope` facade that designsystem actually
calls has near-zero coverage, and nothing pins style-merge precedence — the exact
mechanism of the 2026-08-15 P0. Without this, every later sweep stays green even when
wrong.

- [x] `StyleResolutionOrderTest` — 5 tests pinning the REAL semantics (see correction below)
- [x] Facade-level smoke tests — 17 new test methods: 11 new `*FacadeTest.kt` files +
      extensions to `ButtonEnabledTest`/`AvatarFallbackTest`; all drive public
      `headless.*` imports only; `separator` already had facade coverage
- [x] Cycle broken — headless test source sets no longer depend on designsystem: branded
      snapshot fixtures/tests moved to designsystem's test sources (all 16 pinned signature
      hashes matched byte-for-byte, zero re-record), neutral `UiSnapshotWriter` moved to
      `:awake:ui:testing` desktopMain, `UiCrossPlatformQualityTest` given a local neutral
      theme (inert — `button()` reads no ambient theme)
- [x] Fallout fix: `ShadcnAdoptionRecipeTest` missed by package 1's `shadcnEmpty` caller
      sweep (test sources weren't compiled then) — `id` added

**Semantics correction (matters for package 4):** the original sketch here asserted the
variant's unconditional `background(red)` wins at hovered. Reality (pinned by the test,
per `537d13c5`'s own doc + regression test): `resolve()` runs two passes over the whole
`then`-chain — all unconditional rules first, then all matching state rules — so **a state
rule outranks any unconditional, regardless of chain order**. `(defaults{hovered{gray}}
then variant{background(red)})` at hovered = **gray**. The 2026-08-15 P0 was fixed by
making defaults state-neutral, not by flipping precedence. Consequence: package 4's
defaults MUST stay state-neutral (state rules in a base style will always bleed through
variants' unconditional fills); `UiThemeTest`'s inverted invariants enforce this.

```kotlin
// pinned — StyleResolutionOrderTest.kt (actual shipping semantics)
@Test fun stateRuleOutranksLaterUnconditionalOverrideRegardlessOfThenOrder() {
    val defaults = Style { hovered { background(gray) } }
    val variant  = Style { background(red) }
    val composed = defaults then variant
    assertEquals(red, composed.resolve(state(hovered = false)).background)
    assertEquals(gray, composed.resolve(state(hovered = true)).background)  // state pass runs last
}
```

**Done when (met):** precedence pinned (5/5), 165/165 headless suite green without the
designsystem dependency, designsystem 131/132 (the 1 failure is the intentionally-red
package-5 wrap+fill spec), wasmJs test compiles green.

## Package 3 — delete + point fixes (2–3 days) · rows E1–E5, F1–F9, B4, B7

Pure subtraction, ~800 lines, zero design decisions.

Deletions (executed 2026-08-17, ~-708 net lines / 93 files / 13 files deleted):
- [x] Dead headless files/symbols — E1. Also took `MenuItem.kt` whole (incl.
      `intrinsicMenuWidthPx` — its only "user" was a KDoc link). SKIP: `provideTextStyle`
      — package 2's fixture migration gave it 6 live designsystem-test callers
- [x] ui-core zero-caller publics incl. `shadcnShimmer` + `UiApiCompatibility.kt` — E2.
      SKIP: `neutralSurfaceDefaults` (audit mischaracterized it — `internal` with 4 real
      callers). `textureQuad` KEPT — headless now delegates to it (user's camera-preview
      feature); stale TODO replaced with real doc. `UiApiCompatibility` fallout: 24 files
      (not 1) silently bound to the deprecated same-package aliases — all given real
      `ui.api` imports
- [x] `ShadcnIcons` registry + test initializer deleted; `ShadcnComponentContracts.kt`
      split by owner and deleted; `ShadcnAvatarSize` no longer freezes typography at
      enum-init; tautological `ShadcnCheckboxRadiusTest` deleted — E3
- [ ] ~~`UiButtonVariant` + `resolveFill`~~ **RE-PARKED into package 4**: package 2's
      fixture migration made `UiSnapshotFixtures` render 3 variant scenes through the enum
      (hash-pinned). Rewrite those scenes Style-based first, then delete — E4
- [ ] ~~`FigmaModeMatrix`~~ **RE-PARKED**: 3 live fidelity tests call it
      (Drawer/Select/Tooltip) — contradicts the memory-recorded deletion decision; delete
      with the Figma-tooling removal pass, after those tests get a neutral mode matrix — E5
- [x] `pixelPerfectPixel` 4→1 (graphics `Rectangle.kt`, `roundToInt` semantics; all imports
      fixed) — B4
- [x] Duplicate `@DslMarker` deleted — the marker mechanism now actually shadows across
      scopes for the first time; 3 latent implicit-receiver leaks surfaced and fixed — B7

Point fixes:
- [x] `shadcnAlertDialog`: `actions` slot now returns `UiAlertDialogAction?`, convenience
      buttons report Dismiss/Confirm through `shadcnButton` Outline/Primary; orphaned
      `shadcnDialogActionButtonStyle` deleted; sheet/drawer X wired to `onDismissRequest` — F1
- [x] `shadcnTooltip`/`shadcnTooltipText` `id` required-first; 2 call sites fixed — F2
- [x] Ids threaded: avatar badge/group, field separator, table cells now `"$id."`-prefixed
      (table scope was `internal` — zero external impact) — F3
- [x] Unguarded `WidgetState.rememberStateValue` overload deleted; test callers moved to
      the guarded `UiContext` overload — F4
- [x] ~~`Skeleton`/`ProgressBar` styled from `theme.components.slider`~~ — gone with
      the defaults tier in `1cc85482` — F5
- [x] Grip radius `2f` → `2f.dp.toPx()` — F6
- [x] All 8 `shadcnField*` helpers wrap in `shadcnField {}`; `FieldSet`/`FieldGroup` share
      one container helper (gap literals stayed at call sites — new per-preset `ShadcnMetrics`
      fields would be a design decision, not a dedup); file-wide suppressions → per-declaration
      (sized against real detekt output) — F7
- [x] `shadow`/`overlay` roles added to `ShadcnPalette`; scrim consolidated to one path at
      0.5 — **fixed a real bug**: drawer/dialog set `showScrim=true` but never `scrimColor`,
      so their scrim silently never drew. 7/10 `Sp` literals → typography tokens; 4 left
      commented (no matching token / needs signature change) — F8
- [x] `UiIcon.asVector()` unchecked cast → checked `when` with clear error — F9

Verification: ui-core/headless/testing suites green; headless wasmJs test-compile green;
studio + ui-showcase compile green; designsystem 131 run / 2 failed — the known package-5
spec + `ui-panel-controls` signature drift from F7's intentional container fix
(re-recorded after render review + user approval, dated note in the test file). F1's
alert-dialog drift under review at commit time.

```kotlin
// before — ShadcnPopupRecipes.kt:139: id defaulted on a STATE key; two tooltips share one bucket
fun UiScope.shadcnTooltip(..., id: String = "tooltip")
// after
fun UiScope.shadcnTooltip(id: String, ...)   // required, like every stateful widget
```

**Done when:** grep finds no symbol from the deletion list; F1–F9 each locked by the
package-2 tests or a one-line assertion.

## Package 4 — one style channel (~1 week) · rows B1 B2 B3

The core cleanup. One visual property gets exactly one place to live: `Style`.

- [x] ~~Delete the `UiComponentStyles`/`theme.components.*` defaults tier~~ — done by
      HEAD `1cc85482` before this plan started; survivors are comments — B1
- [x] Swept the unconditional theme-token picks in headless — most sites (Toggle,
      Dropdown, Textarea, ProgressBar) were already compliant from packages 1–3; real
      fixes landed in Checkbox/Switch/Slider/RangeSlider (resolved-first, token as
      fallback), TextField's focused-border, and `ResizablePanelGroup.handle()` (had
      no `style` param at all — added one) — B2, commit `451d2254`
- [ ] ~~Delete `resolveFill` + `UiButtonVariant`~~ — still re-parked: `UiSnapshotFixtures`
      renders 3 variant scenes through the enum, hash-pinned; unblocks once those
      scenes render Style-based — E4
- [x] `ShadcnComponentStyles` — confirmed already deleted by an earlier package. Its
      one real unmet goal, a canonical focus ring, didn't exist anywhere (zero
      `focused{}` rules in designsystem); added `shadcnFocusRing()` to
      `ShadcnInputStyles.kt`, composed into `shadcnTextFieldStyle`/`shadcnTextareaStyle`
      via `then` — B3, commit `a48be373`
- [x] Collapsed to `style =` alone: `button(content=)` already had it; deleted
      `DialogProperties.surface`, gave `dialog()` its own `style` param, threaded
      through `shadcnDrawer`/`shadcnDialog`/`shadcnAlertDialog` (both overloads);
      deleted `Radio.kt`'s dead implicit `Style{shape(9999f.dp)}` default (primitive
      already hardcodes the circle unconditionally) — B1, commit `a48be373`

```kotlin
// before — headless/Switch.kt:117 (same shape ×30 across 12 files)
val trackColor = if (checked) theme.colors.primary else theme.colors.muted
// unconditional token pick — no Style can ever re-color a checked track

// after — widget resolves a selected-state pass; token is fallback only
val resolved = style.resolve(state)               // state carries selected = checked
val trackColor = resolved.background ?: theme.colors.muted
// designsystem owns the color, in the one existing channel:
val shadcnSwitchStyle = Style { selected { background(colors.primary) } }
```

**Done when:** every visual property on every widget is reachable through `style =`;
`ShadcnStyleParityTest` + package-2 precedence tests green; no widget reads
`theme.colors.*` as an unconditional override.

## Package 5 — layout unlock (2–3 days) · rows D1 D2 B5

- [x] Land the intrinsic wrap+fill fix at `ColumnScope.kt:94` / `RowScope.kt:81`
      (failing spec `ShadcnButtonGroupTest` already in tree) — D1
      **done**, commit `505be7cee` (2026-08-18). Confirmed live 2026-08-20 re-audit:
      `contributesToWrapWidth`/`contributesToWrapHeight` still correctly exclude
      `Dimension.FillMax` only outside a wrap-content pass, matching the `after` snippet below.
- [x] Delete the 4 workaround species: `withIntrinsicLabelWidth` call sites where now
      redundant, `wrapContentWidthOrDefault()`, `minWidth` param, `withSizeFallback(40dp)` — D1
      **done**, same commit. `wrapContentWidthOrDefault()` was found NOT dead (kept
      deliberately — see package 5's own note elsewhere in this doc for why).
- [x] Consume `UiShapeSpec.RoundedCorners` in button group (zero consumers today; stale
      "impossible" comment at `ShadcnButtonGroupRecipes.kt:95-103`); second consumer:
      toggle-group segments — D2 **done**, same commit — per-corner radii live.
- [x] Delete `LocalShadcnButtonGroup` context + triplicated `shape(0.dp)` mutations once
      the group is a plain row/column — D2 **kept deliberately, not deleted** — found
      structurally required, documented as a deviation from the plan at the time.
- [x] Dedupe `Row.kt`'s 5 measure-block copies into one helper (Column's `smartColumn`
      pattern); fixes the `LocalCacheKey` drift bug — B5 **done**, same commit. Confirmed
      2026-08-20: `Row.kt` (347 lines) is one `resolveMeasuredRow` helper (`Row.kt:37`)
      with 5 thin scope wrappers, matching `Column`'s pattern.

```kotlin
// before — ui-core/layouts/ColumnScope.kt:94 (mirrored RowScope.kt:81)
context.recordMeasuredSlot(slot, contributesToWrapWidth = width != Dimension.FillMax)
// every fillMaxWidth() child excluded from wrap measure → vertical button group
// measures 0 wide, falls back to the 600px frame

// after — FillMax child still reports intrinsic size during a wrap-content pass
val effective = if (context.isWrapContentPass && width == Dimension.FillMax)
    Dimension.WrapContent else width
context.recordMeasuredSlot(slot, contributesToWrapWidth = effective != Dimension.FillMax)
```

**Done when:** `ShadcnButtonGroupTest` spec green; button-group capture PNG shows
labels, wrapped width, filled members, per-corner radii; regression surface
(`LayoutSizingMatrixTest` + 27 ui-core test files) green.

## Package 6 — uniform signatures (~1 week, mechanical) · rows C1–C8, C4, B8, E6, B12

Compiler-driven sweeps. Boring by design.

- [ ] Eliminate click/change callbacks from discrete-interaction widgets — return-value
      idiom (`if (button(id))`, `checked = checkbox(id, checked)`,
      `value = slider(id, value)`); one event contract, immediate-mode native — C9
- [ ] Gesture contract (C9 companion) — **immediate-mode core, Compose-like sugar**:
      - headless: every interactive widget returns one `UiInteraction` result
        (`clicked`, `doubleClicked`, `longPressed`, `hovered`, `pressed`, `focused`,
        `bounds`) from a single recognizer in ui-core's `interactiveSurface` — never
        per-widget timing code, never callbacks. Return values are trial-measure-safe
        by construction (a callback could double-fire during trial passes — the
        `isMeasuring` bug class that shipped 3×).
      - designsystem: thin Compose-familiar sugar allowed —
        `shadcnButton(onClick = {...})` = `if (button(...).clicked) onClick()`,
        documented synchronous-same-frame, wrapper adds zero behavior.
      - visuals: hover/press/focus reactions only via `Style` state blocks.
      - continuous gestures (drag, text) return the new value each frame from
        `WidgetState`-held gesture state. Long-press/double-click need the input-latch
        fix (F11) first.
- [ ] One canonical order everywhere:
      `(id, <state>, modifier, style, enabled, content): Rectangle` (callbacks gone per
      C9; continuous-gesture exceptions documented individually) — C3 C4
- [x] `id: String` required on every stateful widget (kill `canvas` default, `separator`
      nullable-last, tooltip default); fold `semanticId` into `testTag` — C3
      **partial, 2026-08-20**. Investigated against real current source first: C1/C2/C8's
      earlier work already made `id: String` required on nearly every headless widget (button,
      checkbox, switch, textField, dialog, collapsible, resizablePanelGroup, all of Status.kt/
      State.kt, …) — only `canvas` (defaulted `"canvas"`, zero real callers used the default)
      and `separator`'s two overloads (nullable-last, the in-code collision comment the audit
      cites) were still non-required. Both fixed; call sites updated (`Dropdown.kt`'s bare
      `separator()`, `SeparatorWidgetsTest.kt`, and the two designsystem callers that reach the
      headless `separator()` directly — `ShadcnSidebarRecipes.kt`, `ShadcnStatusRecipes.kt`'s
      `shadcnSeparator`, which keeps its OWN nullable `id` with an orientation-derived fallback
      rather than becoming required, since making it required cascades into
      `samples/studio`/`samples/ui-showcase` callers that were out of scope this pass). Also
      confirmed the audit's `disabled`-polarity-inverted-on-`field` finding is stale (no `field`
      widget exists; every widget already uses `enabled: Boolean`) and landed the disabled-alpha
      consolidation: one `UiPrimitiveScope.withDisabledAlpha(enabled) { }` helper in
      `headless/ModifierExports.kt`, replacing 9 (not ~6) open-coded
      `withGraphicsLayerAlpha(if (enabled) 1f else 0.5f)` sites. **Not done**: the canonical
      param-order sweep (`style` position varies 3rd through last across ~10 widgets; `row`'s
      raw-slot `id` sits 4th vs `column`'s 1st) and the `semanticId`-into-`testTag` fold —
      both genuinely touch every widget signature plus every designsystem recipe that mirrors
      one, which is the audit's own flagged highest-risk shape; re-scope as a dedicated pass
      once C4/C6 (designsystem-side signatures) lands, since the two overlap at every recipe
      call site.
- [x] Remove the 16 rule-6 params (`size`, `textSize`, `boxSize`, `thickness`, `radius`,
      `minWidth`, `gap`, …); delete `Modifier.margin()` (silently drops end/bottom) — C5
      **partial, 2026-08-20**. `Modifier.margin()` deleted — confirmed zero callers repo-wide and
      confirmed the drop-end/bottom bug (`= offset(start, top)`, ignored `end`/`bottom` params)
      before deleting. The 16 sizing/spacing params themselves (`avatar`'s `size`/`textSize`,
      `checkbox`'s `boxSize`, `separator`'s `thickness`, etc.) are NOT dead weight — each has a
      real designsystem-recipe caller passing a concrete value today. Removing them means
      rewriting those recipe call sites to route the same value through `Modifier.width()`/
      `height()` instead, i.e. touching `ShadcnAvatarRecipes.kt`, `ShadcnSelectionRecipes.kt`,
      `ShadcnSidebarRecipes.kt` — the exact designsystem-recipe surface C4/C6 owns. Re-scope to
      land alongside that pass rather than as a separate headless-only sweep.
      **update, 2026-08-20**: C4/C6 pass landed below did NOT touch this — the 16 sizing params
      are real rule-6 duplication but each one's removal is itself a per-widget call-site rewrite,
      not something that fell out "for free" from the C4/C6 investigation. Still re-scoped, now
      to ride with whichever pass lands C4's deferred `id`-required sweep (same recipe files).
- [x] `id: String` required on designsystem recipes following headless's convention; 9 `Unit`
      returns that block popup-anchoring; 9 rule-6 params; FQNs in signatures; 8 unexplained
      `public` style fns — C4 **partial, 2026-08-20**. Investigated against real current source:
      audit's counts were stale (see C4 appendix row for the re-derived numbers — real `id`
      nullable/defaulted count is ~10 not ~29, most are legitimate `column`/`row`-style layout
      wrappers not stateful widgets; real Unit-return count is 12 not 9). **Landed**: 3 FQN fixes
      (`ShadcnIcon.kt`, `ShadcnAvatarRecipes.kt`, `ShadcnSelectionGroupRecipes.kt`) and 5 zero-risk
      Unit→Rectangle fixes whose body already tail-calls a Rectangle-returning headless primitive
      (`shadcnIcon`, `shadcnSidebarGroup`, `shadcnSidebarMenu`, `shadcnSidebarMenuSub`,
      `shadcnRadioGroup` in `ShadcnSidebarRecipes.kt`/`ShadcnSelectionGroupRecipes.kt`). **Not
      landed**: `id`-required sweep (per-function judgment needed), the other 7 Unit-return fixes
      (gated on a `ui-headless` `Selection.kt`/`Status.kt` primitive change, since
      `toggleGroup()`/`progress()`/`skeleton()`/`spinner()` are themselves `Unit`-returning), the
      rule-6 params (rides with C5's remainder), the public-style-fn audit (not reached).
- [x] `modifier` on all 9 overlay components (real count, not the audit's original "8");
      replace hand-rolled text measurement with `withIntrinsicLabelSize` — C6
      **done, 2026-08-20**, commit `5e172a65b`. The blocker found on first investigation
      (`popup()`/`dialog()` sized from `Dimension` with no `Modifier` bridge) turned out
      smaller than it looked: the underlying primitive (`UiPopup.kt`) already had the
      `Modifier`-constraint-clamping plumbing from an earlier commit — the real gap was
      just the two `ui-headless` facades (`popup()`, `dialog()`) never forwarding a
      caller's `modifier` at all. Added `modifier: Modifier = Modifier` to both facades,
      forwarded through instead of a hardcoded `Modifier`; all 9 designsystem wrappers
      (`shadcnDropdownMenu`, `shadcnTooltip`, `shadcnTooltipText`, both
      `shadcnAlertDialog` overloads, `shadcnContextMenu`, `shadcnSheet`, `shadcnDrawer`,
      `shadcnDialog`) now accept and forward a real `modifier`. Also closes
      `ui-status.md` risk #7 (`popup()` couldn't take min/max bounds) — same root cause.
      `withIntrinsicLabelSize` text-measurement replacement not separately revisited;
      not found to be a live remaining issue during this pass.
- [x] Rename raw-slot `column`/`row` overloads to `columnAt`/`rowAt` — **partial, done**,
      commit `4ad43d45`. `UiContext.columnAt`/`rowAt` (member) and `UiPrimitiveScope`
      (extension) renamed; root-authoring `UiContext.column`/`row` left as-is (it's the
      primary entry point, not the raw form). The single-21-param-factory /
      `UiContext.create*`-become-internal-forwards half is **not done** — those factories
      are public API consumed directly (not just via `column`/`row`) by ui/headless test
      infra, ui/animation, ui/testing, ui/benchmark, scene/runtime, engine/game-authoring,
      and design-system snapshot fixtures across dozens of call sites. Internal-forwarding
      them breaks cross-module compilation; rerouting every call site overlaps C3–C6's
      signature sweep. Deferred to that pass — C1
- [x] `button()` label form becomes a wrapper over the slot form (after package 4 — the
      prior attempt's regression was a B2 symptom) — C2
      **done, third attempt**. Prereq work (commit `f6fb7cde`, same day) ported the
      package-5 `isWrapContentPass`/`withIntrinsicLabelWidth` exception and the hover-state
      resolution fix into `surfaceCore`, unifying the two previously-drifted
      interactive-surface implementations `resolveInteractiveSurface`/`buttonSlotInternal`
      (label form) and `interactiveSurface`/`surfaceCore` (slot form) called out in the
      prior attempt below. `headless/Button.kt`'s label-form `button()` now delegates to
      the slot-form `button(content: RowScope.(slot) -> Unit)` with a content lambda that
      just renders `text(label, ...)`, no `primitiveButton`/`buttonSlotInternal` call left
      in the label form. Two things had to be preserved explicitly, not "for free" from a
      naive delegation, since the slot form's own row hardcodes
      `Arrangement.Center`/`Vertical.Center` regardless of any per-call alignment request:
      (1) the button's own width is resolved up front via the same `withIntrinsicLabelWidth`
      helper `buttonSlotInternal` used (a real caller width wins unchanged, an unset width
      becomes the label's measured natural width, a `fillMaxWidth()` caught mid an
      ancestor's own WrapContent trial reports that natural width for the trial only) so the
      button is never `WrapContent` by the time the row/text render; (2) the label's own
      `text()` call then claims the button's full resolved content width
      (`Modifier.fillMaxSize()`), so its own `centered` param — not the row's fixed
      `Arrangement.Center` — decides left-vs-centered placement. Verified: targeted
      `UiSemanticWidgetsTest` (`labelButtonHugsIntrinsicWidthWithoutExplicitWidth`,
      `labelButtonRespectsCenteredForRepositioning`) green; full `:awake:ui:headless:desktopTest`,
      `:awake:ui:ui-core:desktopTest`, `:awake:ui:shadcn:desktopTest` green, including
      `ShadcnButtonGroupTest.verticalButtonGroupWrapsContentWidthAndButtonsFillMaxWidth`,
      `ShadcnButtonStateColorTest` (both hover cases), and `UiSnapshotSignatureTest`.
      `:samples:studio:desktopTest` not verified — pre-existing unrelated compile break in
      `StudioShell.kt` (`Unresolved reference 'CAMERA_PREVIEW_CARD_PADDING'`) from
      concurrent in-progress work in that file, out of this pass's scope.
- [x] One style-fn shape: `internal fun shadcnXStyle(values: ShadcnThemeValues, …): Style`;
      merge the 14 `foreground+textSize` re-implementations and twin surface styles — B8
      **done**. `shadcnTextStyle(foreground, size, weight: FontWeight? = null)` in
      `ShadcnTypographyStyles.kt` is now the one canonical foreground+textSize(+weight) shape;
      the 8 pure re-implementations across `ShadcnTableStyles.kt`, `ShadcnFieldStyles.kt`,
      `ShadcnNavigationStyles.kt`, `ShadcnSidebarStyles.kt` route through it (composite ones
      that also set background/border/padding/hover were left as-is -- routing those through
      `shadcnTextStyle then Style {...}` was judged not worth the added indirection for the
      remaining ~6 sites). The byte-identical `shadcnDialogSurfaceStyle`/
      `shadcnAlertDialogSurfaceStyle` twins are merged (`ShadcnPopupRecipes.kt`'s one caller now
      uses `shadcnDialogSurfaceStyle`). `FieldSet`/`FieldGroup` (`ShadcnFieldRecipes.kt`) were
      already sharing `shadcnFieldContainer`, and the "45-line sidebar pair"
      (`shadcnSidebarHeaderButton`/`shadcnSidebarFooterButton`) is a widget-recipe duplication,
      not a style-fn one -- left for a future pass, not attempted here.
- [x] Merge the two `shadcnEmpty` implementations *(recreate unit)* — B8
      **already done** pre-pass -- only `ShadcnStatusRecipes.kt`'s `shadcnEmpty` exists now,
      `ShadcnEmptyRecipes.kt` no longer exists.
- [x] Recreate `shadcnTabs` with a content slot *(recreate unit, below)* — D5
      **done**. The `items`/`selected`-keyed overload in `ShadcnNavigationRecipes.kt` now takes
      `content: ColumnScope.(String) -> Unit = {}` and wraps track+panel in one `column(id)`
      (default empty content preserves the old track-only render for existing callers/goldens).
      Content renders against the frame-stable `selected` input, not the click-mutated
      `resolved` value -- the first draft used `resolved` and hit the exact
      `ColumnScope.claimSlot()` index-mismatch crash `StudioBottomDock`'s own comments warn
      about (branch selection differing between a call's measure and paint pass). Migrated
      `StudioBottomDock.kt`'s dock tabs off its external `when (renderedTab)` onto the new
      content slot as the real-world proof. The label/`selectedIndex: Int` overload is
      unchanged and stays track-only (documented: duplicate labels collapse to the same trigger
      id, use the `items` overload for that case).
- [x] Split `scrollPanel` god function; enum axis instead of `"width"`/`"height"` strings — C7
      **done**. Private `ScrollAxis { Width, Height }` replaces the `"width"`/`"height"`
      strings; `requireBoundedAxis` extracted to a top-level `requireBoundedScrollAxis`, and the
      hand-duplicated vertical/horizontal scrollbar geometry+paint block extracted to one
      axis-parameterized `paintScrollThumb`. `scrollPanel`'s own body shrank from the full
      ~285 lines to the measure/layout/hit-test orchestration; `awake:ui:ui-core` desktopTest
      green (no golden/behavior change intended).
- [x] Repackage `internal/controls/Buttons.kt` (declares the public package from `internal/`) — C8
      **done**, commit `5ced67ae`. Package fixed to `.headless.internal.controls`; surfaced
      same-package implicit resolution in 6 test files + `Button.kt`/`Dropdown.kt`/
      `internal/controls/Toggle.kt`, all fixed with an explicit import, no behavior change.
      `desktopTest` green. The other 12 rows in this package were deliberately not
      attempted in the same pass — genuinely the "touches nearly every widget signature"
      work the package intro warns about. Proposed split for follow-up, not yet scheduled:
      1. C9 return-value idiom (buttons/checkbox/slider callback → return value)
      2. C9 gesture contract (`UiInteraction`, `interactiveSurface` recognizer)
      3. C3/C4/C5/C6 signature sweep (canonical param order, required `id`, kill rule-6
         params, overlay `modifier`)
      4. C1 `column`/`row` rename + single-factory internal forwards
      5. C2 `button()` label-form-as-wrapper (post package 4) — **done, see C2's own row above**
      6. B8/D5/C7 designsystem-facing (style-fn shape, `shadcnEmpty` merge, `shadcnTabs`
         recreate, `scrollPanel` split) — routed to `awake-design-system-engineer`
      7. B12 spacing-vocab sweep (per-site, no bulk rename)
- [x] Park or delete the 7 speculative presets (49 unverifiable positional Dp args) — E6
      **verified load-bearing, kept as-is, no code change**. The package-6 agent's claim holds:
      `ShadcnStylePreset.entries` (all 8 presets, `Vega` plus the 7 flagged as speculative) is
      consumed by `samples/ui-showcase`'s theming picker --
      `GettingStartedContent.kt:229` maps `entries` to labels for the picker UI, and
      `UiShowcaseRuntimeState.kt:114-115` indexes back into `entries` from the picker's
      selection. Deleting or parking any of the 7 would visibly break that picker. The audit's
      "park or delete" assumption is stale; corrected here instead of acted on. The 49
      positional-`Dp`-args readability complaint is separately real but out of this pass's
      scope (would be a signature change to `ShadcnMetrics`'s constructor, not a
      park-or-delete).
- [x] Spacing-vocab sweep — **done**, commits `316a1788` (`ShadcnSpacing` deleted) and
      `077f92b8` (`UiSpacing` deleted). Decision revised 2026-08-18: ui-core/ui-headless
      own no spacing scale at all, matching Compose Foundation's layering (zero built-in
      spacing tokens; only a design-system layer like Material owns a named scale).
      `UiSpacing` deleted, not relocated to headless — every `UiSpacing.xs/.sm/.md/.lg/.xl`
      call site in core/headless inlined to its literal `Dp` value. `ShadcnSpacing` also
      deleted (confirmed dead — zero real callers). Only `Tw` (designsystem) keeps a
      named scale — B12

```kotlin
// before — shadcnTabs models only the track; content panel not expressible;
// index overload breaks on duplicate labels
fun UiScope.shadcnTabs(tabs: List<String>, selected: Int, ...): Int

// after — signature change makes the current body disposable
fun UiScope.shadcnTabs(
    id: String,
    items: List<UiTabItem>,
    selected: String,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    content: ColumnScope.(String) -> Unit,   // the missing panel
): String
```

**Done when:** signature lint (or the package-1 check, extended) passes; no rule-6
params remain; designsystem call sites compile against the canonical shapes.

## Parking lot — decide separately, not blockers

| Item | Row | What | Why parked |
|---|---|---|---|
| Delete headless facade mirror | B9 | **Scoped and re-scoped across 3 passes 2026-08-18. Not landed; B9a now has a real executable plan, B9b resolved as mostly a non-issue, B9c still needs a decision.** `UiScope` is NOT a redundant wall — its docstring states real intent: capability narrowing, hiding Core's raw `UiPrimitiveScope` frame/draw/input escape hatches from widget-recipe authors. **B9a (retire `HeadlessModifier`/headless's `Modifier` type entirely):** 2 stop-and-report passes. Pass 1 found a bare `typealias` can't work (Kotlin forbids a package-level `typealias`+`val` sharing a name, and `UiModifier`'s a `data class` so no companion-object trick). Pass 2 found the real unblock needs no Core change at all — `awake/ui/ui-core/.../modifier/UiModifier.kt` already ships the bare-value idiom for free under a *different* name (`data class UiModifier` the type, `val Modifier: UiModifier` the value) — headless's own type just needs deleting and every file's import/type-position spelling redirected. Measured real size: **~171 files** — `Layout.kt` + 42 other headless-internal files need actual edits (delete the duplicate builders, rewrite the 6 genuine value-add functions to operate on `UiModifier` directly), 128 external files split into 110 pure one-line import redirects (mechanical, sed-able) and 18 with their own `modifier: Modifier` type-position params needing a reviewed rename to `UiModifier`. Proposed 2-phase execution: **Phase 1** — headless-internal rewrite (self-contained, `headless:desktopTest` gates it alone); **Phase 2** — the 128 external import redirects, run after Phase 1 lands. **Phase 1 landed clean 2026-08-18, one pass, no further split needed.** Real file list came in smaller than estimated: the ~43-file headless-internal estimate assumed `internal/controls/`, `internal/text/`, and `internal/layout/` (~20 files) still needed rewriting, but a prior pass had already migrated all of them to `UiModifier` directly — only `Layout.kt` and 20 headless-package top-level files (`Avatar.kt`, `Button.kt`, `Canvas.kt`, `Collapsible.kt`, `Dialog.kt`, `Dropdown.kt`, `Icon.kt`, `Input.kt`, `Menu.kt`, `OtpInput.kt`, `Popup.kt`, `Radio.kt`, `Resizable.kt`, `ScrollState.kt`, `Selection.kt`, `Separator.kt`, `Status.kt`, `Surface.kt`, `Text.kt`, `TextureQuad.kt`, `UiScope.kt`) needed real edits — `ScrollState.kt`'s `Modifier.verticalScroll` forwarder turned out to be a 6th pure duplicate not on the original list, deleted the same way. One extra surprise: 12 `headless:commonTest` files imported the deleted `headless.Modifier`/`.width`/`.height`/`.fillMaxSize` directly (same-package resolution, no explicit import needed before deletion) — fixed as in-scope rename maintenance per the task's own carve-out, plus one non-test, non-headless file (`awake/ui/testing/.../AwakeUiStateMatrix.kt`, a shared test-fixture module `headless:desktopTest` depends on to compile) needed the same `HeadlessModifier`/`toHeadless` cleanup — also fixed, since `headless:desktopTest` cannot go green without it. `HeadlessModifier`/`asPrimitiveModifier`/`toHeadless` are now zero-reference in `headless`'s implementation; `headless:desktopTest` and `headless:verifyUiOwnership` both green. `designsystem`/`samples:ui-showcase` now fail to compile as expected (still importing `headless.Modifier`) — that's Phase 2, not attempted here. **Phase 2 landed 2026-08-18, one pass, no further split needed — but the real fix diverged from the Phase-1 plan's assumption.** Real external-file count: 110 files needed the pure import redirect (matched the estimate closely) plus 17 (not the estimated 18) needed the `modifier: Modifier` → `modifier: UiModifier` type-position rename; `tailwind` (2 files) and 2 `backend:vulkan:desktopTest` files turned up as transitive-dependency surprises not on the original external-file list (`designsystem` depends on `tailwind` via `api(...)`, and `studio`/`ui-showcase` depend on `backend:vulkan` — both had to compile too). The load-bearing discovery: redirecting `designsystem`'s imports straight to `io.github.awakelab.awake.ui.modifier.*` (the mechanical fix Phase 1 implied) fails `designsystem:verifyUiOwnership` — that check bans `import ...ui.(layouts|popup|scope|animate|child|modifier|unstyled)` in designsystem `*Main` sources on purpose (`docs/reference/ui-ownership.md`'s consumer rule: designsystem reaches `ui-headless` for structure, never `ui-core` directly), and Phase 1's full deletion of headless's forwarding wrappers removed the only licensed door through. Fix: added one new file, `awake/ui/headless/.../ModifierExports.kt` — a `typealias UiModifier = io.github...ui.modifier.UiModifier`, a `val Modifier` re-export, and one-line forwarders for the ~13 builder functions (`clickable`, `fillMaxHeight/Size/Width`, `height`/`width`/`widthIn`, `offset`, `padding` (3 overloads, restored the pre-Phase-1 all-defaulted 4-arg signature so existing partial-named-arg call sites keep compiling), `styleable`, `weight`) that `designsystem` `*Main` sources actually use post-redirect; `ScrollState.kt` got its `UiModifier.verticalScroll(state: ScrollState, ...)` forwarder restored the same way (Phase 1 had deleted it as a "pure duplicate" without noticing `ShadcnAdvancedRecipes.kt`/`ShowcaseApp.kt`/etc. depend on the headless-typed overload, since the bare `UiScrollState` core version doesn't accept headless's `ScrollState` wrapper). This is a narrow, deliberate re-introduction of forwarding — not a HeadlessModifier-style wrapper type, just typealias + passthrough — and it's exactly what `docs/reference/ui-ownership.md`'s existing text already licenses ("`ui-headless` layout and state APIs (`column`, `row`, `box`, `Modifier`, `Arrangement`, `weight`, `padding`, `remember*`) remain fine to import directly for structure"). `samples:*` (not `classifiedUiModules`-restricted) kept the direct `ui.modifier.*` imports Phase 1's plan intended. Verification: `designsystem:desktopTest`, `designsystem:verifyUiOwnership`, `headless:verifyUiOwnership`, `headless:desktopTest` all green; `ui-showcase:compileKotlinDesktop`/`compileTestKotlinDesktop` and `studio:compileKotlinDesktop` green (one pre-existing, unrelated `commonTest` break found in `samples/ui-showcase/.../LegacyShowcaseCoreAdapters.kt` — an implicit-receiver ambiguity on a recursive extension-function call, present unmodified since commit `451d2254`, well before this work — confirmed out of scope, not touched). Zero remaining `io.github.awakelab.awake.ui.headless.Modifier`-family imports outside two explicitly-excluded in-progress files (`samples/studio/.../InspectorPanel.kt`, `StudioShell.kt`, both now valid again since the re-export restored their target symbols) and headless's own harmless test alias. **B9a is now fully landed.** **B9b (274 bypass imports):** re-measured at 387 lines/156 files by raw grep, but real investigation found this was the wrong metric — `verifyUiOwnership` already passes green on designsystem's `*Main` sources today; every "bypass" import in scope is a contract-type import (`ui.api`, `ui.style`, `ui.theme`, `Dp`/`Rectangle`/`Style`) package 1 already deliberately left unbanned. **Repoint = 0, formally-allow = the rest.** The one real gap found: `verifyUiOwnership` never runs on `samples:ui-showcase`/`samples:studio` at all (not in `classifiedUiModules`), and designsystem's `build.gradle.kts` depends on `ui-core` via `api(...)` instead of `implementation(...)` — the actual structural leak letting samples reach `ui-core` transitively. Flipping that dependency scope is real enforcement work with its own blast radius (verify every legitimate contract-type consumer still resolves), routed to `awake-ui-quality-engineer` as a scoped follow-up, not attempted here. Also found and fixed in passing: C7's `scrollPanel` split (`32abbefd`) broke `ui-core`'s `verifyUiOwnership` (`paintScrollThumb` trips the naming-lexicon ban) — landed the ledger exemption in `125fa7fb`. **B9c (`UiScope` capability-narrowing):** still needs a design decision before any code moves — not attempted | Touches every widget signature; boundary is better enforced by package-1's live check + `implementation(ui-core)`. B9a has an executable 2-phase plan ready to launch; B9b's real follow-up (samples `verifyUiOwnership` coverage + designsystem's `api`→`implementation` dependency-scope fix) routed to `awake-ui-quality-engineer`; B9c needs a decision |

>
> **Layout (`claimSlot`) vs input/state (`hitTest`/`isActive`/`tryClaimActive`/`releaseActiveIfMatches`/`widgetState`) split — investigated, not executed, recommend NOT doing it.** Compose's own `MeasureScope`/`PointerInputScope` split works because Compose's phases are genuinely separate passes in time (measure happens once per recomposition, pointer input runs in its own coroutine reacting to events later). Awake's immediate-mode model doesn't have that separation: `claimSlot` reserves the rect and `hitTest`/`isActive` are evaluated against that exact rect in the same synchronous call, because there's no later "pointer phase" to defer to — every widget resolves its own hover/active state for its own slot, this frame, right after claiming it. Real evidence, grepped across `ui-core`/`headless`: the canonical claim-then-hit-test pattern repeats in every widget-authoring chokepoint, not as an edge case: `ui-core/layouts/Box.kt` (`box()`: `claimModifiedSlot` then `hitTest(slot)` on the next line), `ui-core/layouts/Surface.kt` (`surfaceCore`: claims a slot, hit-tests it, resolves `isActive`/style, then *re-claims* and *re-hit-tests* once real bounds are known — the file's own comment calls this "claim-slot-then-hit-test order," and says it deliberately "mirrors `resolveInteractiveSurface`/`interact()`... in ui-headless"), `ui-core/layouts/Row.kt`/`Column.kt` (`hovered = modifier.forceHover ?: hitTest(slot)` / `active = ... isActive(id)` right after each `claimSlot`), `ui-core/layouts/LazyList.kt` (`claimModifiedSlot` then `if (hitTest(slot))` for scroll-wheel consumption), `ui-core/modifier/ClickableModifiers.kt` (`resolveClickable`: `hitTest`→`tryClaimActive`→`isActive`→`releaseActiveIfMatches`→`isActive` again, all against a slot the caller just claimed), and `headless/internal/layout/Interaction.kt` (`interact()` — the one function nearly every interactive headless widget funnels through: `claimModifiedSlot` then `hitTest`/`tryClaimActive`/`isActive`/`releaseActiveIfMatches`/`isActive` again, all five calls in one function body). That's every layout composite (`box`/`row`/`column`/`surface`/`scrollPanel`-family) plus the two shared interaction chokepoints (`resolveClickable`, `interact()`) — i.e. the actual places new widgets are authored — needing BOTH scopes simultaneously if split, which means splitting doesn't remove a capability leak, it just forces every one of those ~9 files to hold two receivers (or a combined wrapper type, which recreates the god-receiver problem one level up). `widgetState` is used more independently (text-cursor/skeleton/spinner/collapsible state reads, not tangled with claimSlot in the same expression) but isn't worth its own interface just for that — same argument the P1 doc already made for not scope-gating state, now confirmed: it's fine ambient, no member overlap forces it into either side. **Verdict: do not split.** Recommend recording this as the answer to the P1 row's own step 6, not attempting a follow-up pass.
>
> **Step 4 (`emit`/`emitOverlay`/`context` removal from `UiPrimitiveScope`) — landed 2026-08-19, partial: `emit`/`emitOverlay` removed, `context` kept.** Grepped every real call site of `.emit(`/`.emitOverlay(`/`.context` on a `UiPrimitiveScope`-typed receiver outside `Canvas.kt`, across all three UI modules plus samples. `emit`/`emitOverlay`'s real external footprint was small (5 production call sites — `TextureQuad.kt`, `graphics/ClipScopes.kt` ×4, `layouts/Surface.kt`, plus `headless`'s `Dropdown.kt`/`Icon.kt`/`Overlay.kt`/`BasicText.kt` — and one test, `UiOverlayLayerTest.kt` ×3) and got migrated onto `canvas{}`/`CanvasScope` in the same pass (`CanvasScope` gained one new member, `drawGlyph`, for `BasicText.kt`'s pre-resolved-coordinates case `drawText` doesn't cover). `emit`/`emitOverlay` moved off `UiPrimitiveScope` onto a new internal-only `UiPrimitiveEmitter` interface (`AbstractUiScope` is the one real implementer); `graphics/ShapePainter.kt`'s `dispatchPrimitive` (the raw router underneath `CanvasScope`) narrowed to `internal` and now casts to it. `context`, by contrast, has a real footprint the "9 files" draw-path estimate never covered: production theme/local push-pop in `ui-shadcn` (`ShadcnButtonGroupRecipes.kt`, `ShadcnThemeLocals.kt`) and `ui-headless` (`ScrollState.kt`, `UiScope.requestFocus`), plus hundreds of `primitive.context.createAbsolute/createColumn/createBox(...)` test-scope-factory call sites across all three modules' test suites — a different capability (spawning child scopes from a `UiContext`) than the draw-default-lookup use `CanvasScope.context` closed in step 3, and not something `CanvasScope`/`canvas{}` addresses at all. Per this doc's own stop condition, did not force it through: `context` stays on `UiPrimitiveScope` (documented in place with the file list above), a further-split candidate if ever revisited, not scoped here. Verification: `ui-core`/`headless`/`designsystem` `desktopTest` green, all three `verifyUiOwnership` green, `UiSnapshotSignatureTest` zero drift, `samples:ui-showcase`/`samples:studio` compile.
>
> Draw-scope slice (unchanged from the 2026-08-18 finding, kept for context): **premise partially stale, did not execute.** The audit's assumed member list (`fillRect`/`roundRect`/`path`/`texture`/`textRun`) doesn't exist on `UiPrimitiveScope` — real draw output is a sealed `UiDrawPrimitive` (`Quad`/`RoundedQuad`/`Glyph`/`FilledPath`/`StrokedPath`/`Texture`/`GradientQuad`/`ShadowQuad` + 3 clip markers, `awake/ui/graphics/.../UiDrawPrimitive.kt`), emitted through exactly 2 raw methods (`emit`/`emitOverlay`) that are already the ONLY draw-shaped members on `UiPrimitiveScope` itself (`UiPrimitiveScope.kt`) — the rest of the interface is layout/state (`claimSlot`, `hitTest`, `isActive`, `tryClaimActive`, `releaseActiveIfMatches`, `widgetState`), not draw. The audit's own call-out is stale: `scrollPanel` and `Checkbox` do **not** inline their own draw logic — both already call shared helpers in one file, `ui-core/graphics/ShapePainter.kt` (`emitFillShape`, `emitFillAndBorder`, `emitCheckmark`, `emitRadioDot`, `emitInsetDash`), which `headless/internal/controls/Surface.kt`'s `paintSurface` (the `resolveStyle→paintSurface` chokepoint the audit wanted) already funnels through. Real remaining raw `emit`/`emitOverlay` call sites outside those shared helpers: 9 main-source files (`ui-core`: `TextureQuad.kt`, `layouts/Surface.kt`, `graphics/ClipScopes.kt`; `headless`: `ResizablePanelGroup.kt`, `Overlay.kt`, `Dropdown.kt`, `Icon.kt`, `BasicText.kt`) — each already the single canonical function for its own concern (`textureQuad()`, `clip{}`, `overlayScrim()`, `icon()`, `renderTextBlock()`), not scattered duplication. Bigger finding: a narrow, member-based draw scope matching this row's own Compose-`DrawScope` ask **already exists** — `CanvasScope` (`ui-core/.../Canvas.kt`): `drawRect`/`drawRoundRect`/`drawShape`/`drawCircle`/`drawLine`/`fillPath`/`strokePath`/`drawText`/`drawImage`/`drawGradientRect`/`drawGradientBorder`/`clipRect`/`clipPath`/`clipShape`, privately wrapping `UiPrimitiveScope` and handed out only inside `canvas {}` (`UiPrimitiveScope.canvas(...)`). Adding a second, differently-named `UiDrawScope` interface duplicating `CanvasScope`'s member set would itself be the "twin nouns" anti-pattern this same audit bans elsewhere (see the P2 lexicon row) — did not add one. The real remaining gap is narrower and harder than what was scoped: rewiring `ShapePainter.kt`'s shared helpers (and `border()`/`gradientRect()`/`gradientBorder()`) to operate on `CanvasScope` instead of raw `UiPrimitiveScope`, so `paintSurface` hands out `CanvasScope` rather than calling `UiPrimitiveScope` extensions directly. That's blocked on a real design decision every one of those helpers currently ducks: they default their color params via `context.current(LocalTheme)...` reached off `UiPrimitiveScope.context`, so narrowing the receiver means deciding whether `CanvasScope` grows theme-default params or callers resolve colors before calling — not mechanical, touches `ShapePainter.kt` + `BorderPrimitives.kt` + `GradientFillPrimitives.kt`/`GradientBorderPrimitives.kt` + all 17 of `emitFillAndBorder`'s call sites. **Follow-up note carried forward:** `textureQuad` (`UiPrimitiveScope.textureQuad` in `ui-core`, re-exported bare at `UiScope.textureQuad` in `ui-headless`) is still a raw draw primitive with no consumer-facing wrapper — Compose's own equivalent, `DrawScope.drawImage`, sits at the `compose-ui` layer too, but `compose-foundation`'s `Image()` composable wraps it for normal consumer use; Awake has the raw primitive but no headless/designsystem-level image widget — worth adding regardless of how the `CanvasScope`/`ShapePainter.kt` question above resolves
>
> **Landed 2026-08-19** (`docs/tasks/2026-08-18-ui-capability-scopes-plan.md` steps 2-3, Option B decided 2026-08-18): `ShapePainter.kt`'s four helpers moved from `UiPrimitiveScope` onto `CanvasScope` and were renamed to `draw*` (`drawFillAndBorder`/`drawCheckmark`/`drawRadioDot`/`drawInsetDash`) per the P2 lexicon decision below; `paintSurface` and all other real callers (13 production + 2 test call sites — bigger than the doc's own "9 files" estimate, which counted a different thing: raw `emit`/`emitOverlay` sites, not `emitFillAndBorder` callers) now resolve their theme-derived color before entering `canvas { }`, since `CanvasScope` has no ambient theme/context access. `CanvasScope.context` is deleted (the backing `scope` field went `private`→`internal` instead, so same-module helpers can still route through it internally). `border()`/`gradientRect()`/`gradientBorder()` were deliberately left on `UiPrimitiveScope`, unmigrated — out of this pass's real scope, each has exactly one caller relying on its internal theme default. `emitPrimitive` (the `emit`/`emitOverlay` router `CanvasScope`'s own `draw*` members call underneath) was renamed to `dispatchPrimitive` and kept on `UiPrimitiveScope`, not `draw*`-named — legitimately one layer below the draw scope, not a widget-facing verb. `verifyUiOwnership`'s exemption for `graphics/ShapePainter.kt` is removed; the file now passes the lexicon check with zero exemptions. The OTHER capabilities (layout/state/animation/focus/theme providers — ~140 extension functions still resolve on `UiPrimitiveScope`) remain untouched, as before | Architectural; the draw-capability half of this row is mostly already solved by `ShapePainter.kt` + `CanvasScope`, not a "build UiDrawScope" task — what's left is a theme/context-threading design decision (does `CanvasScope` gain default-color params, or do widget-chrome callers pre-resolve colors) before `paintSurface` can be rewired onto it; the OTHER capabilities (layout/state/animation/focus/theme providers — ~140 extension functions still resolve on `UiPrimitiveScope`) remain the actual "god receiver" surface and are untouched by this note |
| Layout module placement | P3 (new, 2026-08-18) | `column`/`row`/`box`/`Modifier`/`Arrangement` layout math currently lives inside `ui-core` alongside rendering/input/state; `ui-headless` re-exports it under its own package for consumers. **Real Compose precedent checked**: `Column`/`Row`/`Box`/`Arrangement` live in `androidx.compose.foundation.layout`, the SAME `compose-foundation` artifact that owns unstyled interaction behavior (`clickable`, `BasicText`) — Compose does not split layout into its own module. Only `Modifier` (the interface) sits one layer below, in `compose-ui` (≈ `ui-core`). Mapped onto Awake, Compose's own layering argues layout should move fully INTO `ui-headless` (compose-foundation's shape), not out to a third module. **Premise narrowed 2026-08-21**: the Compose precedent cited here is real and still supports the move, but the broader `ui-headless` ≈ `compose-foundation` framing it leans on is not — Foundation contains no controls, and 21 of `ui-headless`'s 47 public functions are controls Compose ships in Material (see `docs/reference/ui-ownership.md`'s "`ui-headless` is not `compose-foundation`"). So this row argues for co-locating layout with unstyled behavior, which is defensible on its own terms, not for making `ui-headless` into a Foundation port | Not sized — needs its own scoping pass (what exactly moves, migration blast radius across headless/designsystem/samples) before any agent starts it; raised but explicitly deferred 2026-08-18 |
| Rename `CanvasScope` → `DrawScope` | P4 (new, 2026-08-18) | Real Compose has only ONE draw scope type, `DrawScope` — multiple entry points (`Canvas{}`, `Modifier.drawBehind{}`, `Modifier.drawWithContent{}`) all hand out that same type; "Canvas" is only an entry-point function name in Compose, never a scope-type name. Awake's `CanvasScope` couples its one entry point (`canvas{}`) to its type name instead (matching Awake's own `column{}`/`ColumnScope` convention), which is a legitimate but divergent choice, not wrong — flagged because the user wants it noted, not because it's broken | Not scoped, not sized — real rename across every `CanvasScope` reference plus a naming decision (does `canvas{}` the entry point also rename, or stay while only the type changes, mirroring Compose's own entry-point-name ≠ type-name split?); raised but explicitly deferred 2026-08-18 |
| Runtime duplicate-id collision check | P5 (new, 2026-08-20; **implemented 2026-08-20**) | Investigated whether a runtime check can catch a caller-supplied literal `id` reused across two sibling widget instances (the case the required-`id` fix, `c1a6dab10`, does NOT close). Prior pass (same day) found `widgetStateInternal(id)` unsafe as the hook — `TextField.kt:161`/`:331` call `widgetState(id)` twice within one real render of one `textField()` instance (once directly, once via its own private `caretBlinkElapsedSeconds` helper) — and concluded a new widget-instance bracket primitive would be needed. **Re-examined that same TextField evidence at the public-function-boundary angle the task asked about**: both `widgetState(id)` calls happen inside the single call to the public entry point `textField()` (the second one is `textField()`'s own private helper, not a second public function) — so a check that fires once per *public entry-point call*, not once per `widgetState()` call, sidesteps the false-positive entirely without needing any new bracket primitive. Traced the real chokepoint further and found something better than a manual per-function hook: `recordSemantic(id = ...)` (`UiScopeSemantics.kt` → `UiContext.recordSemanticInternal` → already gated `if (!measuring)`, so trial passes are already excluded) is called **exactly once per real render of every id-bearing widget checked**, either directly or through exactly one shared internal chokepoint per widget family: `surfaceCore` (`ui-core/layouts/Surface.kt`) for `surface`/`interactiveSurface` and everything built on them (`avatar`, `separator`, every `shadcn*` recipe including all 4 previously-fixed bugs — `shadcnAvatarBadge`, `shadcnAvatarGroup`, `shadcnFieldSeparator`, `shadcnSidebarMenuSub` — all route through `surface`), an equivalent internal chokepoint in `Column.kt` for `column(id = ...)`, and directly inside `checkbox`/`radio`/`textField`/`textarea`/`lazyColumn`/`lazyRow`/`resizablePanelGroup`'s `panel`/`handle`/`toast`/`progressBar`/`skeleton`/`switch`/`toggle`/`slider`/`rangeSlider`/`dropdown`/`canvas`/`text` (via `semanticId`). Checked every one of those for a same-id-twice-in-one-instance pattern (the exact TextField trap) and found **zero** — `Checkbox.kt`'s 2 `recordSemantic` calls are `checkbox()` and `radio()`, two separate public functions with independently-scoped ids, not one instance calling twice; same shape for `ResizablePanelGroup.kt`'s `panel()`/`handle()` and `LazyList.kt`'s `lazyColumn()`/`lazyRow()`. This makes `recordSemantic` a strictly better hook than a manual public-entry-point convention: it is an EXISTING, ALREADY-UNIVERSAL call already made by nearly every id-bearing widget, so the check needs zero new call sites added to any of the "few dozen" widget functions — one ~15-line change in one file. **Implemented**: `UiContextFrameState.kt` gained a per-frame `HashSet<String>` (`claimedSemanticIdsThisFrame`, cleared in `beginFrame` alongside the existing clip-stack clears) and `recordSemantic(node)` now does `node.id?.let { if (!claimedSemanticIdsThisFrame.add(it)) error(...) }` before delegating to the semantic collector — a hard `error()` throw, matching this codebase's only existing precedent for a serious-but-recoverable authoring bug (`Dimension.resolve`'s `error("WrapContent must be resolved...")`), since no `Log.warn`-equivalent convention exists anywhere in `awake` (`ui-core`/`headless` have zero `println`/logger usage) to prefer instead. Residual honesty caveat: this covers every id-bearing widget actually read in this pass (surface family, column family, and the dozen-plus direct callers listed above) but was not proven exhaustive against literally every widget file in `headless`/`designsystem` — a widget that takes an `id` and never reaches `recordSemantic` (none found) would silently miss this check rather than false-positive, which is the safe failure direction. **Verification**: `:awake:ui:ui-core:desktopTest` green (the module the change lives in, self-contained). `:awake:ui:headless:desktopTest`/`:designsystem:desktopTest`/`:testing:desktopTest` could NOT be run — blocked by an unrelated, concurrent, in-progress edit to `Dialog.kt`/`Popup.kt` (`Unresolved reference 'Modifier'`) from a different agent's parallel Popup.kt/UiPopup.kt task running at the same time, confirmed via `git status` showing those two files mid-modification and unrelated to this change; re-run those three suites once that concurrent edit lands | Implemented in `awake/ui/ui-core/src/commonMain/kotlin/io/github/awakelab/awake/ui/context/UiContextFrameState.kt`; `ui-core` desktopTest green; `headless`/`designsystem`/`testing` desktopTest still needed once the concurrent Popup.kt/Dialog.kt edit in flight from another agent lands and those modules compile again |

## Appendix — full findings matrix

Four audits, one row per consolidated finding. Complexity: 1 = mechanical, hours ·
2 = a day · 3 = days, cross-file · 4 = week+, cross-module · 5 = architectural (none
found). Verdict `recreate` = that unit is cheaper rewritten than patched.

### Why refactor wins (evidence summary)

1. The rot is peripheral; the load-bearing engine (measure pass, `Style` resolver,
   `UiLocal` stacks, glyph layout, drag conservation) is coherent and carries
   named-after-the-bug regression tests.
2. Enforcement was silently off (A1/A2); dirt regrowth is preventable, not inherent.
3. The 2026-08-15 five style channels are already three — the consolidation path is
   proven on this codebase, locked by tests.
4. 524 tests + 89 goldens + 26-case CSS oracle + OKLCH pipeline are non-transferable
   sunk value; a recreate re-earns those bugs at full price and hits the same missing
   primitives.

| B1 | Live style channels beyond `Style`: `UiComponentStyles` defaults tier (16 headless sites), `resolveFill`, designsystem's 7 delivery paths (`style=`, theme default, `styleable`, `then`, `DialogProperties.surface`, omission, non-Style params) | `ui-core/theme/UiComponentStyles.kt`, `headless/internal/controls/Buttons.kt:67,248`, designsystem-wide | Collapse to `style =` alone | refactor | 3 |
| B2 | 6th undocumented channel: 30 unconditional theme-token picks no `Style` can override | `Checkbox.kt:94-95,127,190`, `Switch.kt:117,148`, `Slider.kt:112,131-132`, `RangeSlider.kt:183,203-204`, `Toggle.kt:53-57`, `Dropdown.kt:61-62,119-120,177`, `TextField.kt:96,98,273`, `Textarea.kt:97,280`, `ResizablePanelGroup.kt:222,232,255`, `ProgressBar.kt:57` | Selected-state slots in `Style`; token = fallback | refactor | 3 |
| B3 | `ShadcnComponentStyles` competes with recipe styles on 9 widgets; owns the module's only `focused {}` rule — focus ring existence depends on merge order | `designsystem/ShadcnComponentStyles.kt:18-76` | Rewrite token-only + `shadcnFocusRing()` fragment | **recreate** | 3 |
| B4 | `pixelPerfectPixel` ×4, 2 tie-rounding rules — border and icon snap .5px opposite ways | `ui-core/scope/UiScopeMetrics.kt:25`, `ui-core/api/layout/LayoutValues.kt:80`, `graphics/UiDensity.kt:31`, `graphics/api/layout/Rectangle.kt:27` | Keep one (`roundToInt` semantics), delete 3 | refactor | 1 |
| B5 | `Row.kt` 50-line measure block ×5, drifted: only `AbsoluteScope.row` reads `LocalCacheKey` — and passes the wrong key downstream | `ui-core/layouts/Row.kt:25-332` | One helper + 4 thin wrappers (Column's pattern) | refactor | 2 |
| B6 | ~~`UiContext` 821 lines: 31 `@Deprecated` one-line forwards re-exposed 3–4×; ui-core calls its own deprecated layer from 15 sites~~ — **done**, commit `451d2254d`. Confirmed 2026-08-20: `UiContext.kt` now 698 lines, zero `@Deprecated` annotations. Never had a checklist entry in any package (appendix-only), noted here so it isn't re-scoped by mistake | `ui-core/context/UiContext.kt`; callers in `Row.kt`, `Column.kt`, `Surface.kt` | Re-point 15 callers, delete the mirror in one commit | refactor | 3 |
| B7 | Two `@DslMarker AwakeUiDsl` — headless `UiScope{}` does not shadow enclosing `UiPrimitiveScope` | `ui-core/UiDslMarker.kt:9` vs `headless/UiScope.kt:19` | Delete headless copy | refactor | 1 |
| B8 | Designsystem dupes: 2 shipping `shadcnEmpty`; 14 `foreground+textSize` re-impls; byte-identical dialog surface styles; 45-line sidebar pair; `FieldSet`/`FieldGroup` identical modulo one Dp; 8 style-fn signature shapes | `ShadcnEmptyRecipes.kt:25` vs `ShadcnStatusRecipes.kt:141`; `ShadcnFieldStyles.kt`, `ShadcnPopupStyles.kt:45,52-53`, `ShadcnSidebarRecipes.kt:61-151` | Merge/delete/extract; one style-fn shape | recreate (empty) / refactor | 2 |
| B9 | Headless facade wall half-built: `HeadlessModifier` mirror + second `UiScope`; `primitive` escape public (used 6× by designsystem); 48 unwrapped imports bypass it | `headless/Layout.kt:34-40`, `headless/UiScope.kt:24-29` | Delete mirror; enforce via check + dependency scope | refactor | 4 |
| B10 | Mutable process globals: `UiShape.base` (second shape system beside `UiTheme.shapes`), `UiDensity.scale`/`fontScale` | `ui-core/style/UiShape.kt:24`, `graphics/UiDensity.kt:13,18` | `val`; density into context long-term | refactor | 2/4 |
| B11 | 6 packages split across module pairs — `internal` and import checks structurally can't work; `heroicons` package missing `.awake` | `ui`, `ui.api`, `ui.api.layout`, `ui.graphics`, `ui.scope`, `ui.theme` | Unique roots; fold into awakelab rename | refactor | 3 |
| B12 | 3 spacing vocabularies (decision recorded, sweep pending — must be per-site: bulk rename would launder 4 known-wrong values) + 5 unit vocabularies in designsystem | `ui-status.md` risk 5; `ShadcnInputOtpRecipes.kt:40-49`, `ShadcnVariants.kt:26,64` | Per-site sweep; `Dp` on all metric fields | refactor | 2 |

### C. Overloading / non-uniform API

| # | Dirt | Where | Suggestion | Verdict | Cx |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | `column` ×12 entry points incl. 20/21-param twins; silent-wrong-overload trap documented in-tree ("infinite trial / OOM") | `UiContext.kt:125,148,257`, `UiLayoutFactory.kt:33`, `NestedLayouts.kt:21`, `Column.kt:282-395`, `UiScopeNesting.kt:19` | `columnAt`/`rowAt` renames; internal factory forwards | refactor | 2 |
| C2 | `button()` label vs slot form: opposite sizing (wrap vs fill) and opposite theming (reads theme vs reads nothing), one name | `headless/Button.kt:25-42` vs `:85-114` | Label form wraps slot form (after B2) | refactor | 2 |
| C3 | Headless signatures: `style` position varies across ~10 widgets (3rd/4th/5th/6th/7th/last); `id` mostly already required (C1/C2/C8 work landed this), but `canvas` still defaulted (`id: String = "canvas"`, zero real callers used the default) and `separator` (both overloads) still nullable-last with an in-code collision comment; `row`'s raw-slot `id` sits 4th while `column`'s sits 1st (same-shape inconsistency, left alone per C1's note — overlaps the deferred factory-forwarding work); no widget named `field` exists anymore, no inverted-polarity `disabled` param found (already `enabled: Boolean` everywhere) — that finding is stale; disabled-alpha was open-coded `withGraphicsLayerAlpha(if (enabled) 1f else 0.5f)` 9× (not ~6) across `Button.kt` + 8 internal files | headless-wide; `Text.kt:36`; `Canvas.kt:113` (fixed); `Separator.kt` (fixed) | **Landed**: `canvas`'s `id` made required (dead default, zero callers); `separator`'s `id` (both overloads) made required, deprecated-fallback design-system callers updated (`ShadcnStatusRecipes.kt`, `ShadcnSidebarRecipes.kt`) to synthesize a stable id instead of relying on the headless default; one shared `UiPrimitiveScope.withDisabledAlpha(enabled) { }` helper added in `headless/ModifierExports.kt`, all 9 open-coded call sites migrated. **Not landed** (see Package 6 checklist note): full canonical param-order sweep across every widget (`style` position, `row`'s id slot) — genuinely touches every widget file plus every designsystem recipe wrapper that mirrors a headless widget's param shape (e.g. `shadcnSeparator`'s own nullable `id ?: ...` fallback, kept as-is to avoid touching `samples/studio` which was out of scope this pass), which is C4/C6 territory; `semanticId`-into-`testTag` fold not attempted (crosses into `ui-core`'s `Modifier`/`UiModifier` shape, a bigger change than this row's budget) | refactor | 3 (partially landed; remainder re-scoped to ride with C4/C6) |
| C4 | Designsystem signatures: `id` absent ~20 / optional 7 / defaulted 2; 9 `Unit` returns (can't anchor popups); 9 rule-6 params; FQNs in signatures; 8 unexplained `public` style fns. **Re-derived, 2026-08-20** (audit's counts were stale, real picture from a full pass over all 21 recipe files' public signatures): only ~10 functions have a nullable/defaulted `id` (`shadcnAvatarBadge`/`Group`, `shadcnButtonGroupSeparator`, `shadcnField`/`FieldSet`/`FieldGroup`, `shadcnFieldSeparator`, `shadcnSidebarMenu`/`MenuSub`, `shadcnSeparator`), not ~29 — most are non-stateful layout wrappers over `column`/`row` (which themselves keep `id` optional by design per C1's note), not stateful widgets, so "required `id`" isn't a clean mechanical call for them. FQN-in-signature leaks: only 2 real instances (`ShadcnIcon.kt`'s receiver type, `ShadcnAvatarRecipes.kt`'s `Color` param), plus a third found during the sweep not in the original audit (`ShadcnSelectionGroupRecipes.kt`'s `gap: io.github...Dp`). Implicit-`Unit` returns verified via full-signature parsing (matching each `fun` to its real closing paren, not string grep, since return type can sit on a wrapping trailing-lambda line): 12 real instances, not 9 — `shadcnIcon`, `shadcnAccordion`, `shadcnToggleGroup`×2, `shadcnRadioGroup` (content-based overload), `shadcnSidebarGroup`, `shadcnSidebarMenu`, `shadcnSidebarMenuSub`, `shadcnProgress`, `shadcnSkeleton`, `shadcnSpinner`. 5 of those are zero-risk (tail expression already calls a `Rectangle`-returning headless primitive, just not propagated); the other 7 are NOT designsystem-only — `shadcnToggleGroup`/`Progress`/`Skeleton`/`Spinner` wrap headless `toggleGroup()`/`progress()`/`skeleton()`/`spinner()`, themselves `Unit`-returning in `ui-headless`'s `Selection.kt`/`Status.kt`; `shadcnAccordion`'s body loops over multiple items with no single natural "the" bounds (union rect? last item?) | designsystem-wide | One mechanical pass | refactor | 2 (**partial, 2026-08-20**: landed the 3 FQN fixes and the 5 zero-risk Unit→Rectangle fixes (`shadcnIcon`, `shadcnSidebarGroup`, `shadcnSidebarMenu`, `shadcnSidebarMenuSub`, `shadcnRadioGroup`) — `ShadcnIcon.kt`, `ShadcnAvatarRecipes.kt`, `ShadcnSelectionGroupRecipes.kt`, `ShadcnSidebarRecipes.kt`. **Deferred**: the ~10 nullable/defaulted `id` params (needs a per-function judgment call, stateful widget vs. legitimate `column`/`row`-style wrapper); the other 7 Unit-return fixes (gated on a `ui-headless` primitive change to `Selection.kt`/`Status.kt`, own follow-up); the 9 rule-6 sizing params (folded into C5's remainder below); the "8 unexplained `public` style fns" claim not independently re-verified this pass, no evidence gathered) |
| C5 | Headless param bloat: `Modifier.margin()` confirmed zero callers repo-wide and confirmed still silently drops `end`/`bottom` (returns `offset(start, top)` only) — deleted. The other cited sizing/spacing params (`avatar`'s `size`/`textSize`, `checkbox`'s `boxSize`, `separator`'s `thickness`) are real, load-bearing, and each has direct designsystem-recipe callers passing a concrete value (`ShadcnAvatarRecipes.kt`, `ShadcnSelectionRecipes.kt`, `ShadcnSidebarRecipes.kt`/`ShadcnStatusRecipes.kt`) — removing them requires rewriting those recipe call sites to route the same value through `Modifier.width()/height()` instead, which is the C4/C6 designsystem-recipe pass, explicitly held back this round to avoid file collisions | `Avatar.kt:18-53`, `Selection.kt:14-32`, `Separator.kt:28-47`, `Layout.kt:41-46` (margin, deleted) | **Landed**: `Modifier.margin()` deleted. **Not landed**: the 16 sizing/spacing params themselves — re-scope as its own pass once C4/C6 lands, since it's the same designsystem call sites | refactor | 2 (margin-deletion sliver landed; param removal re-scoped to ride with C4/C6) |
| C6 | 8 overlays take `Dimension`/`Dp`, none has `modifier`; `Dimension.FillMax` in public API (banned); hand-rolled text measurement with magic 40/80/128. **Investigated, 2026-08-20**: confirmed the real count is 9 overlay functions (`shadcnContextMenu`, `shadcnSheet`, `shadcnDrawer`, `shadcnDialog` in `ShadcnOverlayRecipes.kt`; `shadcnDropdownMenu`, `shadcnTooltip`, `shadcnTooltipText`, `shadcnAlertDialog`×2 in `ShadcnPopupRecipes.kt`), none take `modifier`. This is genuinely NOT a designsystem-only mechanical fix: `width`/`height: Dimension` params exist because the underlying `ui-headless` primitives they call — `popup()` (`Popup.kt:57`) and `dialog()` (`Dialog.kt:39`) — themselves size from `Dimension`, not `Modifier`; there is no existing `Modifier`→`Dimension` bridge at this call boundary (unlike `column`/`row`, which resolve a modifier's `fillMaxWidth()`/`width()` internally during layout). Adding `modifier: Modifier` to the 9 designsystem functions without first giving `popup()`/`dialog()` an equivalent capability would just be a second parallel, ignored parameter — worse than the status quo. Confirmed against `docs/reference/ui-ownership.md`: `Dimension.FillMax` "must not appear in public Headless or Design System authoring APIs" — no designsystem function defaults to `Dimension.FillMax` literally in its signature (`shadcnDrawer` computes it conditionally inside the body from a `Dp size` param, never exposed), so this specific finding is more about the `Dimension`-typed param itself being public API surface than a literal FillMax leak. `withIntrinsicLabelSize`/`withIntrinsicLabelWidth` grepped: the magic-number text measurement this audit row cites (`ShadcnPopupRecipes.kt`'s dropdown-menu width calc, `40f.dp`/`80f`/`128f.dp` literals) is real and still present (`ShadcnPopupRecipes.kt:81-88`) — routing it through the shared helper is plausible but was not attempted this pass given the higher-priority `Dimension`/`Modifier` finding took the full investigation budget. `popup()` min/max bounds (`docs/reference/ui-status.md` risk 7, verified verbatim: `UiModifier.widthIn(max=)` exists but `popup()` sizes from a `Dimension` so the constraint can't reach it, `AlertDialog` parked at a fixed 320dp because of this) is the same root cause as the `modifier` finding — both need one `ui-headless` `popup()`/`dialog()` plumbing change first | `ShadcnPopupRecipes.kt:63-64,131-132,182-185`, `ShadcnOverlayRecipes.kt:82,128,133-134` | `modifier` on all 8; `withIntrinsicLabelSize`; also fix `popup()` min/max bounds (ui-status risk 7) | refactor | 3 (**not landed this pass** — nothing genuinely safe/mechanical found at the designsystem layer alone; real fix is a `ui-headless` `popup()`/`dialog()` plumbing change (give them a `modifier: Modifier` or a min/max-aware sizing param that resolves to `Dimension` internally, the same way `column`/`row` already do), which then unblocks all 9 designsystem overlay signatures, the `FillMax`-as-public-param cleanup, the magic-number→`withIntrinsicLabelSize` swap, and ui-status risk 7 in one follow-up pass. Proposed split: (1) `ui-headless` `popup()`/`dialog()` modifier+bounds plumbing (owns the real risk, `awake:ui:headless` only); (2) designsystem call-site sweep once (1) lands, bundled with the deferred rule-6/id items from C4/C5) |
| C7 | `scrollPanel` 285-line god function; stringly axis `"width"`/`"height"` beside real enums | `ui-core/ScrollContainers.kt:49-333` | Split axis fns; extract scrollbar paint + viewport geometry | refactor | 2 |
| C8 | `internal/controls/Buttons.kt` declares the public package from `internal/`; `internal.*` packages not Kotlin-`internal` | `headless/internal/controls/Buttons.kt:3` | Repackage; real `internal` after F10 | refactor | 1 |
| C9 | Mixed event idioms: `button` returns a result (immediate-mode native), `toggle`/`checkbox`/`switch`/`slider` take `onCheckedChange`/`onValueChange` callbacks (retained-mode idiom), some expose both — three contracts for "did the user interact" | headless `Selection.kt`, `Switch.kt`, `Slider.kt` vs `Button.kt` | Eliminate discrete-event callbacks: interaction returns the new state (`if (button(id))`, `checked = checkbox(id, checked)`, `value = slider(id, value)`); callbacks only if a continuous gesture genuinely needs one | refactor | 3 |
| C10 | Redundant overloading beyond C1/C2: parallel `*Slot` entry points (`buttonSlot`, `toggleSlot`) shadow the widget's own slot form — overloading by name; designsystem twin overloads of one recipe use different style mechanisms (`shadcnButton` `styleable` at :64 vs `then` at :91); avatar/toggleGroup dual forms | headless entry-point list (`ui-component-coverage.md`), `ShadcnButtonRecipes.kt:64,91` | One primary slot form + at most one string-convenience wrapper per widget (wrapper delegates, never re-implements); delete `*Slot` names; twin overloads share one mechanism | refactor | 2 |

### D. Missing primitives

| # | Dirt | Where | Suggestion | Verdict | Cx |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Intrinsic wrap+fill fix not landed; failing spec in tree; 4 workaround species downstream | `ui-core/layouts/ColumnScope.kt:94`, `RowScope.kt:81`; spec `ShadcnButtonGroupTest.kt:42` | Two-line fix, delete workarounds | refactor | 3 |
| D2 | `UiShapeSpec.RoundedCorners` landed (fe90a848), zero consumers; stale "impossible" comment steering work wrong | `graphics/UiPath.kt:231` vs `ShadcnButtonGroupRecipes.kt:95-103` | Consume in button group (after D1), toggle group next | refactor | 2 |
| D3 | No focus ring anywhere; `ring` token exists and is tested, zero draw sites | token `api/theme/UiThemeValues.kt:42` | One `ResolvedStyle` ring field + one draw in `paintSurface` | refactor | 2 |
| D4 | Select/combobox popover has no container panel style hook ("page shows through gaps") | `headless/Dropdown.kt:19-39` | `menuStyle: Style` + surface behind options | refactor | 2 |
| D5 | `shadcnTabs` no content slot; lossy index overload; no real headless `tabs()` | `ShadcnNavigationRecipes.kt:138-180` | New content-slot signature | **recreate** | 3 |
| D6 | Parity gaps: selected checkmark, tooltip arrow, indeterminate visual (renders as checked), input-group affix starvation, string-only table cells, dialog X unwired | designsystem agent finding 19 | Additive; several need headless hooks first | refactor | 3 |
| D7 | Untyped px space (2× drag class unguarded); magic `4096f` ×9; `verifyUiAuthoredUnits` only catches literal `.px` | `UiContext.kt:810-815`, `UiSliderMath.kt:6` | `value class Px`; named `UNBOUNDED_AXIS_PX` | refactor | 4/1 |

### E. Dead code / stranded

| # | Dirt | Where | Suggestion | Verdict | Cx |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | 5 dead headless files (~330 lines) + 6 symbols; pattern: every composite bypassed by its `shadcn*` counterpart (tooltip's dropped hover timer = the instability symptom) | `Accordion.kt`, `Field.kt`, `NumberField.kt`, `Tooltip.kt`, `UiEdge.kt`, `menu()`, `tabs()`, `ActionRow.kt` | Delete | recreate (delete) | 1 |
| E2 | 12 zero-caller ui-core publics incl. `shadcnShimmer` (brand in core); `UiApiCompatibility.kt` alive only via same-package implicit resolution | `StyleModifiers.kt:13`, `TextureQuad.kt:14`, `Surface.kt:49`, `UiApiCompatibility.kt` | Delete ~130 lines; add `\bshadcn[A-Z]` pattern to core/headless check | refactor | 1 |
| E3 | `ShadcnIcons`: 32 `lateinit` globals + public re-runnable init for a dependency cycle deleted in `a0b71c93` | `ShadcnComponentContracts.kt:15-94` | Delete registry; direct `HeroIcons.*`; split the rest of the audit-exempt contracts god-file; fix `ShadcnAvatarSize` freezing typography at class-load | refactor | 1 |
| E4 | `UiButtonVariant.Filled/Outline/Ghost` + `resolveFill`: branded vocab in headless, zero production callers | `headless/internal/controls/Buttons.kt:231-256` | Delete; behavior moves to `Style` | refactor | 1 |
| E5 | `FigmaModeMatrix` (deletion already decided in memory) + uncommitted scratch probe test | `testing/ui/FigmaModeMatrix.kt`, `designsystem/desktopTest/.../ScratchAlertDialogProbeTest.kt` | Delete both | refactor | 1 |
| E6 | 7 of 8 theme presets speculative: 49 unverifiable positional `Dp` args, 7.4K test pinning numbers with no oracle | `ShadcnTheme.kt:28-83` | Keep Vega; park or delete rest; named args if kept | refactor | 2 |

### F. Correctness bugs found in passing

| # | Dirt | Where | Cx |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | `shadcnAlertDialog` result `action` never assigned; both button returns discarded; dialog X drawn but not wired to dismiss | `ShadcnPopupRecipes.kt:187-222`, `ShadcnOverlayRecipes.kt:103,143` | 2 |
| F2 | Tooltip `id = "tooltip"` default — two tooltips share one `WidgetState` bucket (frame-instability root cause) | `ShadcnPopupRecipes.kt:139,167` | 1 |
| F3 | Hardcoded colliding widget ids | `ShadcnAvatarRecipes.kt:37,49`, `ShadcnFieldRecipes.kt:118,124`, `ShadcnTableRecipes.kt:39,43` | 1 |
| F4 | `WidgetState.rememberStateValue` omits `isMeasuring` guard the same file documents as shipping 3× | `ui-core/state/UiStateHooks.kt:82-85` | 1 |
| F5 | `Skeleton` + `ProgressBar` styled from `theme.components.slider` | `Skeleton.kt:44`, `ProgressBar.kt:43` | 1 |
| F6 | Grip radius `2f` raw px — half-size at dpr 2; `handle()` has no style param | `ResizablePanelGroup.kt:255-256` | 1 |
| F7 | 8 `shadcnField*` helpers emit label+widget as siblings, no container — bug class already fixed+documented in `shadcnRadioGroup` | `ShadcnFieldRecipes.kt:131-257` | 2 |
| F8 | Color/type literals outside theme files: shadows, scrim 0.48 (shadcn 0.5) + second scrim mechanism, 9 `Sp` literals bypassing typography | `ShadcnCardStyles.kt:21`, `ShadcnOverlayRecipes.kt:87`, `ShadcnSidebarStyles.kt` | 1 |
| F9 | `UiIcon.asVector()` unchecked cast | `headless/Icon.kt:11` | 1 |
| F10 | Test suite tests the layer below the public API; no merge-precedence test — the safety-net gap gating all sweeps | headless commonTest | 2 |
| F11 | ~~Pointer pipeline stores latest state only~~ — **done**, commit `42a3180e`. Root cause was the shared `awake:core` `Input` class, not `bindWindowPointerInput` alone — fixed there so every platform bridge (wasm/GLFW/Android/iOS) inherited the fix at once. Added `pointerPressed`/`pointerReleased` edges to `InputSnapshot`, mirroring the existing `keysPressed`/`keysReleased` pattern | `awake:core/input/Input.kt` | 2 |
