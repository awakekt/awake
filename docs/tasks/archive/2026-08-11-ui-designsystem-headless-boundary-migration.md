# Final Plan: UI API / Core / Headless Boundary

> **Superseded visual-policy decision (2026-08-15):** the module-boundary work in this document
> remains historical context, but its prohibition of `UiComponentStyles` in Core and its
> `SurfaceVisuals` target are no longer authoritative. Core owns the neutral
> `UiComponentStyles` contract and `CoreUiComponentStyles` fallback; Design System overrides it.
> Headless accepts and applies `Style` with state rules. `SurfaceStyle`/`SurfaceVisuals` are
> deprecated compatibility bridges during migration.

## Outcome

`ui-designsystem` compiles only against `ui-headless` and `ui-api`. It has no `ui-core`
dependency and cannot import raw UI runtime capabilities. Public call sites remain Compose-like:

```kotlin
uiScope.shadcnDialog(...)
uiScope.shadcnButton(...)
```

## Final Module Model

```text
ui-api
  Stable, runtime-free value contracts only: UiBounds, Dimension, Dp, Sp, and
  color/shape/typography value contracts. Move structural contracts here only
  when they have no UiContext, renderer, or runtime dependency.
  May depend only on genuine lower-level contracts such as awake-core Color.

ui-core
  UiContext, UiPrimitiveScope, frame lifecycle, layout, draw collection,
  hit testing, input/focus/state, renderer-facing mechanics, and a neutral
  fallback resolver including the neutral UiComponentStyles/CoreUiComponentStyles contract.
  No branded component recipes or named variants.
  Depends on ui-api.

ui-headless
  Public UiScope, ColumnScope, RowScope, BoxScope, and AbsoluteScope facades;
  generic leaf widgets, interaction behavior, and neutral Style application,
  including Style state rules. These
  scopes hold internal raw primitive-scope references. No named variants.
  Depends on ui-api and implementation(ui-core).

ui-designsystem
  UiScope.shadcn* recipes, named themes, token instances, branded variants,
  icons, and branded composition. It maps branded variants to Style and overrides
  Core's neutral component styles. Depends on ui-api and ui-headless. Never depends on ui-core.

ui-dsl (when production composition warrants the module)
  Neutral multi-widget/tooling composition such as property rows, inspector
  scaffolds, and tooling shells. Depends on Headless; it is not a Headless export.

apps/samples
  May assemble ui-core, ui-headless, and designsystem. Root integration creates
  UiScope from UiContext; component call sites use only UiScope.
```

`UiScope` is the public headless facade. Rename the current raw scope to
`UiPrimitiveScope`. Do not add a fourth facade module, use friend modules, or add a
`headless { ... }` call-site block.

## Guardrails

- `ui-headless` must not expose `UiContext`, `UiPrimitiveScope`, or any core-only type in a
  public signature; otherwise its implementation dependency leaks.
- Public layout scopes (`ColumnScope`, `RowScope`, `BoxScope`, `AbsoluteScope`) belong in
  `ui-headless` alongside public `UiScope`. They are behavioral DSL receivers, not immutable
  API contracts. Core keeps separate raw `UiPrimitive*Scope` implementations.
- Advanced custom primitive authoring remains deliberate: provide a named primitive-authoring
  dependency/API for consumers that genuinely need `UiPrimitiveScope`; do not expose it through
  designsystem or ordinary headless APIs.
- `awake.ui-ownership-convention` remains defense in depth, not the primary boundary.
- Named variants (`Primary`, `Ghost`, `Outline`, and brand vocabulary) are forbidden in
  `ui-headless`; Core's component-style contract remains neutral and unbranded.

## Implementation Sequence

### Phase 0 — Freeze and inventory

1. Add this document to the work lane and avoid unrelated UI ownership moves.
2. Inventory all `ui-designsystem` imports from core and every public signature containing a core
   type.
3. Classify every item as `ui-api` contract, reusable headless behavior, branded composition, or
   deliberate advanced primitive authoring.

Gate: the inventory has a target module and test owner for every item.

### Phase 1 — Classify contracts and introduce `ui-api`

1. Create `:awake:ui:ui-api`.
2. Move pure values first: units, bounds/dimensions, and color/shape/typography contracts. Keep
   `UiContext`, drawing/layout machinery, and any type with runtime behavior in Core. Do not
   move behavioral scope receivers to `ui-api` merely to make a dependency graph compile.
3. Keep Core's neutral `UiComponentStyles`/`CoreUiComponentStyles` contract and route component
   defaults through `Style`. Design System supplies branded overrides through the same contract;
   do not create a parallel Headless visual DTO registry.
4. Make `ui-core` depend on `ui-api`; update imports with no behavior changes.

Gate: all moved types compile on every existing KMP target and `ui-api` has no dependency on
`ui-core`.

### Phase 2 — Split raw scope from public scope

1. Rename the current `UiScope` to `UiPrimitiveScope` within core.
2. Move the author-facing `UiScope` FQN into `ui-headless`; it contains an internal primitive
   backing reference.
3. Add `UiContext.createUiScope()` in headless for root/app integration.
4. Adapt generic headless widgets to the facade without changing their behavior.

Gate: app roots can create the new `UiScope`; existing headless desktop tests remain green.

### Phase 3 — Enforce the classpath boundary

1. Change headless to `implementation(project(":awake:ui:ui-core"))`.
2. Remove every `ui-core` dependency from designsystem.
3. Ensure every designsystem public signature uses only `ui-api` or headless types.
4. Add a compile-only consumer fixture that depends on designsystem and proves `UiContext` and
   `UiPrimitiveScope` cannot be imported.

Gate: designsystem's `commonMain` compile classpath has no ui-core and the consumer fixture
compiles.

### Phase 4 — Vertical behavior and visual-policy migration

Migrate one behavior at a time, always retaining `UiScope.shadcn*` syntax:

1. **Complete:** Button plus its generic visual states and `shadcnButton` variant mapping
   (proof slice).
2. **Complete:** Dialog plus `overlayScrim`, including runtime-free `card`/`popover` theme
   roles consumed through `UiThemeValues`.
3. Sheet and drawer mechanics.
4. Popup/dropdown/menu position, selection, and scrolling.
5. Tabs and collapsible state/measurement.
6. OTP focus traversal, resize drag handling, and remaining reusable drawing/layout helpers.

For each slice: move generic behavior and neutral `Style` application to Headless; leave Shadcn
tokens, named variants, and composition in Design System; and add a Headless behavior test plus
Design System desktop regression coverage.

### Phase 5 — Defense-in-depth enforcement

1. Expand `ui-ownership-convention` to reject core dependencies, `UiPrimitiveScope`, `UiContext`,
   core-package imports, and known implementation escape hatches in designsystem.
2. Add negative Gradle fixture tests proving each prohibited reference fails.
3. Require designsystem checks and the consumer fixture in CI.

Gate: a direct core reference from designsystem fails locally and in CI.

### Phase 6 — Document and stabilize

1. Update `docs/reference/ui-ownership.md` with the final module graph and allowed `ui-api`
   contract list.
2. Document the advanced primitive-authoring path separately from ordinary widget authoring.
3. Update sample/root integration examples and generated API docs.

## Definition of Done

- Designs system has no ui-core compile dependency or public core type leakage.
- UI core runtime is reachable only through intended integration or advanced primitive-authoring
  paths.
- Reusable behavior lives in headless and branded policy lives in designsystem.
- Compose-style `UiScope.shadcn*` call sites stay intact.
- Compile fixtures, targeted tests, and CI prevent boundary regressions.

## Current implementation status (2026-08-12)

Migration is **100% complete for public component-family facades** and approximately **99%
complete for the overall boundary migration** (the remaining work is test-fixture cleanup, not
production component coverage). The current
slice includes Headless-native paths for navigation/disclosure (Tabs, Breadcrumb, Accordion,
Collapsible), sidebar/table/OTP, avatars, status widgets, fields, and the neutral text contracts
(`UiTextWrap`/`UiTextOverflow`) used by Design System recipes.

The remaining work is the compatibility-removal phase: legacy Core-receiver implementations and
the existing Showcase regression fixtures still compile as deprecated bridges. Design System
tests now compile without the compatibility module. Showcase production pages
now use Headless/API contracts; its legacy compatibility dependency remains only for older
regression fixtures isolated in test-only adapters. The sample's compatibility dependency is now
test-scoped, and the public component files use enforced `Shadcn*` family naming. The authoritative completion
gate is not facade count; it is removal of the `ui-designsystem -> ui-core` commonMain dependency,
zero raw Core imports in Design System production sources, and a negative consumer fixture proving
`UiContext`/`UiPrimitiveScope` are unavailable. Until those gates pass, the migration must not be
reported as complete.

The public `ui-designsystem` artifact now compiles only against `ui-api` and `ui-headless`. Legacy
Core receivers are physically isolated in the source tree of
`:awake:ui:designsystem-compat`, which is intentionally temporary and is wired only into
migration consumers/tests. The public boundary now has both source and classpath gates: the audit
requires zero Core imports and the compile classpath check rejects `ui-core`. Scene overlays also
have a `headlessFrame` entry point and Headless owns the scroll-state wrapper used by consumer
migrations. Public design-system overlay recipes now cover context menus, drawers, and dialogs
without Core types. Runtime-free theme values are adapted by Core at the integration boundary,
so configured design-system palettes remain intact without reintroducing a Core dependency into
the public artifact. Neutral dropdown entry/result contracts now live in `ui-headless`, while
the design-system only maps `ShadcnMenuEntry` into them. `samples:studio`, `samples:scene3d-playground`, and the Vulkan UI capture
tests now build without the compatibility module. `samples:ui-showcase` is still whitelisted only
because its legacy regression fixtures have not yet been converted; its production compile graph
is compatibility-free, and its full desktop suite plus refreshed Headless semantic/pixel baselines
pass against the migrated production pages. Public Combobox, Sheet, and Toast recipes now also
delegate to Headless behavior and are covered by a boundary test. The remaining one percent is
the deliberate removal or conversion of test-only Core compatibility fixtures. Those fixtures are
now isolated to one audited test/migration consumer (Showcase tests);
the Headless snapshot fixture has been migrated to `createUiScope` and Headless layout scopes.
They are not a production `ui-designsystem` dependency leak. A
component-coverage audit now verifies all 23 public recipe files (25 component files including
two contract-only files) delegate through `ui-headless`; contract-only files are explicitly
allowed, so future components cannot silently reintroduce Core-backed recipes. Select now maps
Shadcn field tokens into Headless neutral and selected-state visuals instead of inheriting Core's
fallback styling. Headless Combobox owns popup/filter/selection behavior, while Design System
supplies the Shadcn visual policy and exposes both the indexed and controlled generic overloads;
the focused interaction test covers filtering and selection. Duplicate public Kbd and Avatar
recipes that had been copied into the `components.status` family were removed; the general
component family is now canonical, and `status` owns only progress, skeleton, spinner, and toast
status recipes. Cross-platform linking also verifies that compatibility fixtures reuse canonical
public contracts; duplicate `ShadcnTableColumn`/`ShadcnTableCellAlign` declarations were removed
from the bridge after the iOS linker exposed the collision.
