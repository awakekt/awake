# UI capability-scoped receivers — simplified plan

Companion to the "Capability-scoped receivers" (P1) row in
`docs/audits/2026-08-17-ui-refactor-vs-recreate-audit.md`. That row is the full
evidence trail; this doc is the shape of the end state and the concrete steps to
get there, re-verified against real source on 2026-08-18.

## Why

`UiPrimitiveScope` mixes draw, layout, and input/state on one interface, plus a
public `context: UiContext` field its own doc comment says to never expose:

```kotlin
// awake/ui/ui-core/.../UiPrimitiveScope.kt — today
interface UiPrimitiveScope {
    val context: UiContext              // "Never expose this" — but it's public
    fun claimSlot(width, height, weight): Rectangle   // layout
    fun hitTest(slot): Boolean                        // input
    fun isActive(id): Boolean                         // input/state
    fun tryClaimActive(id, hovered)                   // input/state
    fun releaseActiveIfMatches(id)                    // input/state
    fun emit(primitive: UiDrawPrimitive)              // draw
    fun emitOverlay(primitive: UiDrawPrimitive)         // draw
    fun widgetState(id): WidgetState                   // state
}
```

Real Compose precedent (verified against Compose's own source, not assumed):
`DrawScope`, `MeasureScope`, and `@Composable` scope are each a narrow interface
carrying only their own phase's capability — nothing has a field that exposes the
layer below.

## What already exists (found 2026-08-18, corrects the audit's stale assumption)

A narrow draw scope already exists — `CanvasScope` (`ui-core/Canvas.kt`), handed
out only inside `canvas {}`:

```kotlin
class CanvasScope internal constructor(
    private val scope: UiPrimitiveScope,
    val bounds: Rectangle,
) {
    val context get() = scope.context   // ← same leak, one level down
    fun drawRect(x, y, width, height, color, overlay = false)
    fun drawRoundRect(...)
    fun drawShape(...)
    fun fillPath(...)
    fun strokePath(...)
    fun drawText(...)
    fun drawImage(...)
    fun drawGradientRect(...)
    fun clipRect(...)
    // …
}
```

Building a second, differently-named `UiDrawScope` would duplicate this — the
"twin nouns" pattern the audit itself bans elsewhere. **`CanvasScope` is the draw
scope.** No new type needed for that slice.

The real gap: `ShapePainter.kt`'s shared paint helpers (used by `scrollPanel`,
`Checkbox`, and everything routed through `paintSurface`) are extension functions
on `UiPrimitiveScope` directly, not on `CanvasScope`:

```kotlin
// awake/ui/ui-core/.../graphics/ShapePainter.kt — today
fun UiPrimitiveScope.emitFillAndBorder(...)   // bypasses CanvasScope entirely
fun UiPrimitiveScope.emitCheckmark(slot: Rectangle)
fun UiPrimitiveScope.emitRadioDot(slot: Rectangle, color: Color)
```

So `paintSurface` (the intended single widget-chrome path) still reaches
`UiPrimitiveScope`'s raw draw primitives directly, not through `CanvasScope`.

`emit*` is also the wrong verb — the audit's naming-lexicon decision (P2,
`docs/audits/2026-08-17-ui-refactor-vs-recreate-audit.md`) already settled
`draw*` as the reserved verb for painting members on a draw-capable scope, with
`emit*` banned outright. That decision was explicitly deferred with "decide
with P1" — this migration is that moment, since these functions are moving onto
`CanvasScope` (the draw scope) anyway.

## Final shape — before and after, together

Everything above lands as one coherent change, not three separate half-steps:

```kotlin
// BEFORE — awake/ui/ui-core/.../graphics/ShapePainter.kt, today
fun UiPrimitiveScope.emitFillAndBorder(fill: Color, border: Color, ...) {
    // draws directly against the raw scope; caller had no choice but
    // to already be holding a UiPrimitiveScope, not a CanvasScope
}
fun UiPrimitiveScope.emitCheckmark(slot: Rectangle) { ... }
fun UiPrimitiveScope.emitRadioDot(slot: Rectangle, color: Color) { ... }

// awake/ui/headless/.../internal/controls/Surface.kt, today
fun paintSurface(scope: UiPrimitiveScope, style: Style, slot: Rectangle) {
    val fill = style.foreground ?: scope.context.current(LocalTheme).colors.foreground
    scope.emitFillAndBorder(fill, border, ...)   // raw scope, emit* verb
}
```

```kotlin
// AFTER — awake/ui/ui-core/.../graphics/ShapePainter.kt
fun CanvasScope.drawFillAndBorder(fill: Color, border: Color, ...) {
    // draws through CanvasScope's own public API (drawRect/fillPath/etc);
    // fill/border are always caller-resolved, this function never touches theme
}
fun CanvasScope.drawCheckmark(slot: Rectangle) { ... }
fun CanvasScope.drawRadioDot(slot: Rectangle, color: Color) { ... }

// awake/ui/headless/.../internal/controls/Surface.kt
fun UiScope.paintSurface(style: Style, slot: Rectangle) {
    val fill = style.foreground ?: LocalTheme.current.colors.foreground   // resolved here, once
    canvas {                          // hands out CanvasScope
        drawFillAndBorder(fill, border, ...)   // draw* verb, no theme access needed
    }
}
```

Net result: `CanvasScope.context` has no remaining caller once this lands, so it
gets deleted — the leak this whole slice exists to close is actually closed, not
just relocated. `UiPrimitiveScope.emit`/`emitOverlay` (the lower-level interface
members `CanvasScope`'s own `drawRect`/etc. call internally) are a separate,
legitimate case and are NOT renamed — they're the raw primitive-emission path
underneath the draw scope, not a widget-facing verb the lexicon rule targets.

## The blocking decision

`ShapePainter`'s helpers read default colors off `UiPrimitiveScope.context` (theme
lookup). Rewiring them onto `CanvasScope` means picking one:

**Option A — `CanvasScope` grows theme-default params.**
```kotlin
fun CanvasScope.emitFillAndBorder(fill: Color? = null, border: Color? = null) {
    val resolvedFill = fill ?: context.current(LocalTheme).colors.foreground
    // ...
}
```
Keeps call sites simple; `CanvasScope` now needs to know about theme resolution,
which it currently doesn't.

**Option B — callers pre-resolve colors before calling `CanvasScope`.**
```kotlin
fun UiScope.checkbox(...) {
    val fill = style.foreground ?: LocalTheme.current.colors.foreground  // resolved here
    canvas { emitFillAndBorder(fill, border) }   // CanvasScope never touches theme
}
```
Keeps `CanvasScope` a pure draw surface (closer to real `DrawScope`, which also
never resolves theme values itself — the caller passes a `Color`). More call
sites touched, but each change is mechanical.

**Decided 2026-08-18: Option B.** Callers pre-resolve colors; `CanvasScope`
stays a pure draw surface, matching real `DrawScope`, and removes the reason
`CanvasScope.context` exists at all.

## Sequence

1. **Decide A vs B** (above) — blocks everything else in this doc.
2. **Migrate `ShapePainter`'s helpers onto `CanvasScope`**, `paintSurface` hands
   out `CanvasScope` instead of calling `UiPrimitiveScope` extensions. Small,
   contained: 9 files use raw `emit`/`emitOverlay` outside the shared helpers
   today (`TextureQuad.kt`, `layouts/Surface.kt`, `graphics/ClipScopes.kt`,
   `ResizablePanelGroup.kt`, `Overlay.kt`, `Dropdown.kt`, `Icon.kt`,
   `BasicText.kt`) — each already its own canonical function, not scattered
   duplication.

   **Landed 2026-08-19.** `ShapePainter.kt`'s four helpers moved onto
   `CanvasScope` and were renamed per the naming-lexicon decision above:
   `emitFillAndBorder`→`drawFillAndBorder`, `emitCheckmark`→`drawCheckmark`,
   `emitRadioDot`→`drawRadioDot`, `emitInsetDash`→`drawInsetDash`. The private
   dispatch helper (`fun UiPrimitiveScope.emitPrimitive` → renamed
   `dispatchPrimitive`, kept on `UiPrimitiveScope`, NOT `draw*`-named — it's
   the raw emit/emitOverlay router `CanvasScope`'s own `draw*` members and
   `BorderPrimitives.kt`/`GradientFillPrimitives.kt` call underneath, one
   layer below the draw scope, not a widget-facing verb). `border()` /
   `gradientRect()` / `gradientBorder()` were left on `UiPrimitiveScope`
   untouched — out of this step's real scope (only `ShapePainter.kt`'s own 4
   functions), each still resolves its own theme default internally and has
   exactly one real caller relying on that default, not worth touching here.

   Real call-site count was bigger than the "9 files" estimate above (that
   estimate was raw `emit`/`emitOverlay` call sites, a different count from
   `emitFillAndBorder`'s own callers): 13 real production call sites plus 2
   test call sites needed a `canvas { }` wrap and, in 6 of them, hoisting a
   `theme.colors.X` lookup out of the `canvas {}` lambda into a local `val`
   first (`CanvasScope` has no ambient `theme`/`context` access, so any
   caller-side default has to be resolved *before* entering the block, not
   inside it) — `ScrollContainers.kt` (×2), `layouts/Surface.kt`,
   `headless/internal/controls/Surface.kt` (`paintSurface`), `Checkbox.kt`
   (×3), `Slider.kt`, `ProgressBar.kt`, `RangeSlider.kt`, `Spinner.kt`,
   `Switch.kt`, `Skeleton.kt`, `Text.kt`, `TextField.kt`, `Textarea.kt` (×2),
   plus `UiOverlayLayerTest.kt` and `ReusableCompositionTest.kt`. Still
   mechanical (each fix was "wrap in `canvas{}`, hoist the color lookup
   above it"), just wider than the original estimate — did not need a
   further split. `graphics/ShapePainter.kt`'s naming-lexicon exemption
   (`build-logic/.../awake.ui-ownership-convention.gradle.kts`) is removed;
   `verifyUiOwnership` passes on the file with zero exemptions now.
3. **Drop `CanvasScope.context`** once nothing inside `ui-core` needs it anymore
   (only possible after step 2, if Option B was chosen).

   **Landed 2026-08-19.** The public `val context get() = scope.context`
   accessor is deleted from `CanvasScope`; the backing `scope` field changed
   from `private` to `internal` so `ShapePainter.kt` (same module, different
   package) can still route through `scope.dispatchPrimitive`/`scope.border`/
   `scope.emitsToOverlay`. `drawText`'s own pre-existing default
   `color`/`font`/`textStyle` parameters (an existing `CanvasScope`
   capability, not part of the `ShapePainter` migration) still needed
   `UiContext` internally — fixed by reading `scope.context.current(...)`
   directly inside the class body instead of through the now-removed public
   property; nothing outside `CanvasScope` ever reached `.context` on a
   `CanvasScope` instance (verified by grep), so the leak this row exists to
   close is actually closed, not relocated.
4. **Shrink `UiPrimitiveScope`** — once draw is fully behind `CanvasScope`, drop
   `emit`/`emitOverlay`/`context` from the interface. What remains:
   ```kotlin
   interface UiPrimitiveScope {
       fun claimSlot(width, height, weight): Rectangle
       fun hitTest(slot): Boolean
       fun isActive(id): Boolean
       fun tryClaimActive(id, hovered)
       fun releaseActiveIfMatches(id)
       fun widgetState(id): WidgetState
   }
   ```

   **Landed 2026-08-19, partial: `emit`/`emitOverlay` removed, `context` kept.**
   Grepped every real call site of `.emit(`/`.emitOverlay(`/`.context` on a
   `UiPrimitiveScope`-typed receiver outside `Canvas.kt`, across `ui-core`,
   `headless`, `designsystem`, and `samples/*`.

   `emit`/`emitOverlay`'s real footprint outside `Canvas.kt` was small and
   entirely mechanical, once the implicit-receiver call sites inside other
   `UiPrimitiveScope` extension functions were grepped too (bare `emit(...)`,
   not just `.emit(...)` — the draw-path estimate in step 2 missed these
   because they don't use CanvasScope's helpers at all, they emit raw
   primitives directly): `TextureQuad.kt`, `graphics/ClipScopes.kt` (×4, the
   clip push/pop primitives), `layouts/Surface.kt` (the shadow primitive) in
   `ui-core`; `headless/internal/controls/Dropdown.kt` (chevron icon),
   `Icon.kt` (×2, fill/overlay variants), `internal/layout/Overlay.kt` (the
   scrim), `internal/text/BasicText.kt` (per-glyph emission, the one case
   with no existing `CanvasScope` equivalent) in `headless`; and one test,
   `UiOverlayLayerTest.kt` (×3). All migrated onto `canvas{}`/`CanvasScope`.
   `CanvasScope` gained one new member, `drawGlyph`, for `BasicText.kt`'s
   case: unlike every other `draw*` member, it takes an already-absolute
   destination rect (BasicText resolves glyph position against its own
   line/pen metrics, which `CanvasScope` has no visibility into), so callers
   wrap it in `canvas(Rectangle(0f, 0f, 0f, 0f))` — a zero-size, zero-origin
   slot keeps `drawGlyph`'s (and `Icon.kt`/`Dropdown.kt`'s `fillPath`, whose
   paths `fitTo(slot)` already resolved to absolute coordinates) implicit
   `CanvasScope` bounds-translate a no-op.

   `emit`/`emitOverlay` moved off the public `UiPrimitiveScope` onto a new
   internal-only `UiPrimitiveEmitter` interface declared next to
   `UiPrimitiveScope` (`AbstractUiScope` is the one real implementer of
   both). `graphics/ShapePainter.kt`'s `dispatchPrimitive` -- the raw
   primitive router underneath `CanvasScope`'s own `draw*` members --
   narrowed from public to `internal` and now casts its `UiPrimitiveScope`
   receiver to `UiPrimitiveEmitter` before routing.

   `context`, by contrast, turned out to have a real footprint the "9
   files" draw-path estimate never covered, because it was never a
   draw-only concern to begin with: production theme/local push-pop in
   `ui-designsystem` (`ShadcnButtonGroupRecipes.kt`'s `registerMember`/
   `pushLocal`/`popLocal`/`current`, `ShadcnThemeLocals.kt`'s `current`) and
   `ui-headless` (`ScrollState.kt`'s `with(primitive.context) { ... }`,
   `UiScope.kt`'s `requestFocus`), plus hundreds of
   `primitive.context.createAbsolute/createColumn/createBox(...)`
   test-scope-factory call sites spread across all three modules' test
   suites. This is a different capability than the draw-default-lookup use
   `CanvasScope.context` closed in step 3 (spawning a *new child scope* from
   a `UiContext`, not resolving a theme default for the current draw call) --
   `CanvasScope`/`canvas{}` doesn't address it at all, and migrating
   hundreds of test call sites plus 4 production files onto some other
   entry point is an order of magnitude bigger than this step's real scope.
   Per this doc's own "if the real scope turns out larger, stop and report"
   guidance, did not force it through: `context` stays on `UiPrimitiveScope`
   for now, documented in place with the file list above and in the audit's
   P1 row. A further split (if ever revisited) needs its own scoped plan,
   not a continuation of this one.

   Verification: `ui-core`/`headless`/`designsystem` `desktopTest` green,
   all three `verifyUiOwnership` green, `UiSnapshotSignatureTest` zero
   drift, `samples:ui-showcase`/`samples:studio` compile.
5. **`UiScope`'s `.primitive` escape hatch** — once `UiPrimitiveScope` no longer
   exposes anything dangerous, decide whether `UiScope` still needs a wrapper
   field at all, or can just extend the (now-safe) `UiPrimitiveScope` directly:
   ```kotlin
   interface UiScope {
       val primitive: UiPrimitiveScope   // today: a real escape hatch
   }
   // →
   interface UiScope : UiPrimitiveScope   // tomorrow: nothing left to escape into
   ```
6. **Layout vs interaction split — investigated 2026-08-18, REJECTED. Not
   scoped for execution; nothing implemented.**

   Compose's `MeasureScope`/`PointerInputScope` split works because those really
   are separate phases in time: measure runs once per recomposition, pointer
   input reacts later, in its own coroutine, inside `Modifier.pointerInput{}`.
   Awake's immediate-mode model has no such separation — every widget claims its
   slot and evaluates `hitTest`/`isActive` against that exact slot in the same
   synchronous call, because there's no later phase to hand off to.

   Grepped every real call site of `claimSlot` vs `hitTest`/`isActive`/
   `tryClaimActive`/`releaseActiveIfMatches` across `ui-core`/`headless`. The
   claim-then-hit-test pattern is the norm at every real widget-authoring
   chokepoint, not an edge case:
   - `ui-core/layouts/Box.kt` (`box()`): `claimModifiedSlot` then `hitTest(slot)`
     the very next line.
   - `ui-core/layouts/Surface.kt` (`surfaceCore`, the shared chrome path every
     `shadcn*` surface widget funnels through): claims a slot, hit-tests it,
     resolves `isActive`, then *re-claims and re-hit-tests* once real bounds are
     known for wrap-content sizing — the file's own comment names this
     "claim-slot-then-hit-test order" and says it deliberately mirrors
     `interact()` in ui-headless.
   - `ui-core/layouts/Row.kt` / `Column.kt`: `hovered = modifier.forceHover ?:
     hitTest(slot)` / `active = ... isActive(id)` immediately after each
     `claimSlot`.
   - `ui-core/layouts/LazyList.kt`: `claimModifiedSlot` then `if (hitTest(slot))`
     for scroll-wheel consumption.
   - `ui-core/modifier/ClickableModifiers.kt` (`resolveClickable`): `hitTest` →
     `tryClaimActive` → `isActive` → `releaseActiveIfMatches` → `isActive` again,
     all against a slot the caller just claimed.
   - `headless/internal/layout/Interaction.kt` (`interact()` — the one function
     nearly every interactive headless widget calls): `claimModifiedSlot` then
     `hitTest`/`tryClaimActive`/`isActive`/`releaseActiveIfMatches`/`isActive`
     again, five calls in one function body:

     ```kotlin
     // headless/internal/layout/Interaction.kt — real code, the shared chokepoint
     internal fun UiPrimitiveScope.interact(
         id: String,
         modifier: UiModifier = Modifier,
         enabled: Boolean = true,
     ): UiInteraction {
         val slot = claimModifiedSlot(modifier)        // layout
         val hovered = hitTest(slot)                     // interaction — needs `slot` from above
         tryClaimActive(id, hovered && enabled)           // interaction
         val wasActiveBeforeRelease = isActive(id)        // interaction
         releaseActiveIfMatches(id)                        // interaction
         val active = isActive(id)                          // interaction
         // …
         return UiInteraction(slot, hovered, active, clicked = ...)
     }
     ```

     Splitting `claimSlot` onto a `UiLayoutScope` and the rest onto a
     `UiInteractionScope` means this one function needs both receivers held at
     once, and every interaction call directly depends on `slot`, the layout
     call's own return value — not a coincidental adjacency, a real data
     dependency.

   That's every layout composite (`box`/`row`/`column`/`surface`/
   `scrollPanel`-family) plus both shared interaction chokepoints
   (`resolveClickable`, `interact()`) needing both capabilities in the same
   function. Splitting `UiPrimitiveScope` here doesn't remove a leak — it forces
   every one of those ~9 files to juggle two receivers simultaneously (or reach
   for a combined wrapper type, which just rebuilds the god receiver one level
   up).

   `widgetState` reads (text cursor, skeleton/spinner animation, collapsible
   height, dropdown expanded flag) are NOT tangled with `claimSlot` in the same
   expression the way `hitTest`/`isActive` are — but that argues for leaving it
   ambient (no scope gate at all, matching Compose's own choice not to gate
   `remember{}`/`mutableStateOf`), not for giving it a third interface just for
   symmetry.

   **Verdict: do not split layout from input/state.** If this gets
   re-litigated later, re-run the grep above first — the interleaving is the
   load-bearing fact, not an impression.

Each numbered step is its own scoped, verified pass — land it, run
`verifyUiOwnership` + the three UI `desktopTest` suites, then decide whether the
next step is still worth it. No step here is "final" until it's actually landed
and re-measured, matching how B9a/B9b/B9c and this doc's own P1 re-measurement
went in practice today.
