# Tasks

## Current Objective

Stabilize Awake's public API boundaries before the next core/scene split. The current focus
is separating core APIs, reusable helpers, and authoring sugar so future module moves do not
just spread unclear ownership across more folders.

## Active Phase

- 2026-08-05: API layering plan added. Use
  [docs/reference/api-layering.md](reference/api-layering.md) as the stable rule and
  [docs/tasks/2026-08-05-api-layering-plan.md](tasks/2026-08-05-api-layering-plan.md) as
  the active ECS/scene cleanup plan.
- 2026-08-05: Phase 2 ECS/scene API classification audit recorded in the API layering
  plan. Demo navmesh bootstrap moved out of `awake:scene`; authored gameplay systems moved
  to the scene3d sample. The scene module split proposal is now tracked in
  [docs/tasks/2026-08-05-scene-module-split-proposal.md](tasks/2026-08-05-scene-module-split-proposal.md).
- 2026-08-05: First scene split slice landed behind the `awake-scene` facade:
  `:awake:scene:core` owns `Transform`/`Name`, and `:awake:scene:rendering` owns
  render-facing scene components plus `RenderSystem`.
- 2026-08-05: Physics scene leaf split landed behind the `awake-scene` facade:
  `:awake:scene:physics` owns `PhysicsBody`/`PhysicsSystem`.
- 2026-08-05: Controls scene leaf split landed behind the `awake-scene` facade:
  `:awake:scene:controls` owns `OrbitControl`/`FreeFlyControl`/`FollowControl`/
  `MovementControl` plus their camera systems. `PlayerControlSystem` stays in
  `:awake:scene` (depends on `ui-core`).
- 2026-08-05: Runtime scene split landed behind the `awake-scene` facade:
  `:awake:scene:runtime` owns `SceneGameRuntime`/`SceneGameSpec`/`SceneRouterSpec`, the
  scene document model, and `SceneAssetLibrary` (moved as one unit -- `SceneGameSpec`
  couples them directly). The deprecated `SceneRuntime` bootstrap stays in `:awake:scene`
  (depends on `TransformSystem`, which hasn't split out yet).
- 2026-08-05: Scene module split Phase 5 (DSL dependency tightening) landed:
  `TransformSystem` moved to `:awake:scene:core`, `PlayerControlSystem` moved into
  `:awake:scene-dsl` directly (needs `ui-core`). `:awake:scene-dsl` now depends on the
  specific `:awake:scene:*` leaf modules it uses instead of the whole `:awake:scene`
  facade -- this completes the module list the split proposal sketched, leaving only
  `NavMesh` and the deprecated `SceneRuntime` bootstrap in `:awake:scene` itself.
- 2026-08-06: `:awake:scene:core` gained `SpinControl`/`SpinSystem` (generic entity
  rotation) and `:awake:scene:controls` gained `LookAtControl`/`LookAtCameraSystem` plus
  `PrimaryOrbitCamera` (a plain lifecycle helper, not an ECS `System`, for a UI-driven
  debug camera entity) -- extracted from duplicated demo boilerplate, following the same
  component+System convention the existing camera controls already use.
- 2026-07-10: `VulkanApplication` now loads `scene.json` through `SceneRuntimeHost`; next
  we peel shared code into smaller modules, starting with math/runtime/utils.
- 2026-08-06: The above core split is done -- confirmed complete via
  [docs/reference/decision-log.md](reference/decision-log.md) D11-D13 and the current
  `settings.gradle.kts` (no `awake:core` module exists anymore): `awake-core` split into
  dependency-free `:awake:base` (math/input/glTF/utils), `:awake:backend:opengl`, and
  `:awake:engine:render-api`; the Vulkan/WebGPU backends physically split into
  `:awake:backend:vulkan`/`:awake:backend:webgpu`. This entry and the matching Open
  Questions/Fix Lanes bullets below were stale, written before D11-D13 landed.
- 2026-08-06: `RotatingCubeDemo` gained a "Camera mode" toggle (Orbit/Follow/Look at),
  wiring the previously-unused `FollowControl`/`LookAtControl` + `FollowCameraSystem`/
  `LookAtCameraSystem` (built 2026-08-06, never attached to any entity until now) onto
  `PrimaryOrbitCamera`'s camera entity -- `PrimaryOrbitCamera.entity` is now a public
  read-only property so a demo can attach extra components to that same entity instead of
  spawning a second camera.

## Open Questions

- Which ECS/scene APIs are true core, which are reusable helpers, and which are only
  authoring sugar?
- Should `SceneGameRuntime` remain renderer/UI aware, or should those concerns move behind
  smaller runtime interfaces during the scene split?
- Do we split `physics` now, or leave it until the scene/runtime shape is settled?
- Should Awake v1 use one universal `Style`, or separate style types immediately for
  text/button/panel families?
- Which properties stay in `UiModifier`, and which must move into the new `Style` layer?
- Should the first UI DSL slice target inspector panels only, or should it also cover
  HUD/menu composition in the same pass?
- Do we want `animate { }` support in the first style pass, or only after the static style
  property model settles?

## Fix Lanes
