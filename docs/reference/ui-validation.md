# UI Validation

This document is the canonical source for Awake's shared UI verification rule.


## Fixture metadata must not come from reflection

`AwakeUiPreviewMetadata` for a fixture must be supplied as data (see `ShowcasePage`), not read
off an `@AwakeUiPreview` annotation. iOS and wasmJs have no reflection, so annotation-driven
fixtures returned a 1x1 dummy and their tests early-returned -- reporting green on three of
four targets while asserting nothing. Use `renderUiPreviews(entry, metadata)`;
`renderAnnotatedUiPreviews` remains only for JVM-only fixtures that have no other option.

## Goal

Stop relying on eyeballing for shared UI regressions.

Awake's reusable UI is only considered done when it has machine-checkable proof for:

- visual rendering
- semantic structure
- text fit and truncation
- content bounds and clipping
- state coverage
- animation coverage when the component animates

## Non-Negotiable Rule

Any change to shared UI in:

- `awake:engine:ui:ui-core`
- `awake:engine:ui:ui-headless`
- `awake:engine:ui-dsl`
- `awake:engine:ui:ui-designsystem`
- shared showcase or docs previews that demonstrate those modules

must ship with automated validation.

Manual browser review is useful, but it is not enough on its own.

## Keep UI Tests Easy to Change

Tests must describe the behavior they prove, not repeat renderer setup. This prevents a small UI
change from becoming a large maintenance task.

- Use `renderUiComponent(...)` for a normal one-frame component test.
- Use `uiTestSession(...)` for interaction or animation across frames.
- Use the named gestures (`hover`, `click`, `doubleClick`, `longPress`, `rightClick`, `drag`)
  instead of repeating normal pointer down/up frames.
- Use exact `UiInputState` only for a wheel, keyboard, or another input the named gesture cannot
  represent.
- Do not create a new test file if an existing matrix or component fixture owns the behavior.
  Add a row or case there.
- Use raw `UiContext` only when the lifecycle itself is what the test proves: Core/runtime,
  layout/cache, renderer/backend, or pixel-fidelity mechanics.
- A test using `beginFrame`, `endFrame`, or `finishFrame` directly in `ui-headless` or
  `ui-designsystem` must declare `@UiLowLevelTest("why this lifecycle is under test")` on the
  class (or a low-level helper file).
  `verifyUiTestLifecycle` runs from `check` and rejects unmarked manual lifecycle code.

Read [UI Testing Dictionary](ui-testing-dictionary.md) when a term is unfamiliar. Prefer clear,
specific names such as `popupDismissesOnOutsideClick`; avoid incident-only names such as
`PopupBugProbe`. A permanent probe must be renamed for the invariant it protects.

## Required Proof By UI Type

### Static Shared Widgets

Every shared widget change must include:

1. a preview or snapshot that renders the widget
2. semantic validation
3. text-fit validation
4. content-fit and clipping validation
5. a stable regression signature when the output is intentionally locked

Required states:

- default
- hovered, pressed, or focused when supported
- disabled when supported
- selected/checked/expanded when supported
- long-text or constrained-width case when text is visible
- light/dark or theme variants when the widget is theme-sensitive

### Shared Layout Or Container APIs

Every layout/container change must include:

1. a preview or snapshot of the composed layout
2. overlap validation for sibling controls that must not collide
3. content-fit validation for clipped or padded regions
4. a stable layout signature or snapshot signature

### Animated Components

Animated shared UI must not be validated only at one rest frame.

Required proof:

1. at least three sampled visual states:
   - rest
   - in-flight
   - settled
2. the same semantic/content-fit checks at each sampled frame
3. explicit allowance for intentional truncation or overlap only when documented in the test

If a component shimmers, expands, fades, slides, or eases between values, the preview/test
must capture more than the final state.

## Canonical Test Surfaces

Use these first:

- `renderUiComponent(...)` (`awake:ui:testing`) for every single-frame Headless or
  design-system component test and snapshot fixture. It owns the frame lifecycle, default input,
  font/density restoration, semantics, and emitted primitives. Install branded locals through
  `rootProvider`; do not duplicate `UiContext.beginFrame`/font/theme/`finishFrame` setup in such
  tests.
- `uiTestSession(...)` (`awake:ui:testing`) for multi-frame pointer, keyboard, focus, and
  animation interaction tests. It keeps the context/input state persistent while retaining the
  same restoration guarantees. Use its built-in `hover`, `click`, `doubleClick`, `longPress`,
  `rightClick`, and `drag` gestures instead of hand-writing press/release frame sequences; use
  `frame(UiInputState, ...)` only when a test needs an exact wheel, keyboard, or secondary-input
  snapshot.
- `AwakeUiPreview` for preview-backed docs and reusable gallery entries
- `validateAwakeUiPreview(...)` for shared preview validation
- `inspectUiFrame(...)` for primitive-level rendering checks
- `inspectSemanticNodes(...)` for semantic integrity
- `inspectSemanticContentFit(...)` for bounds and clipping correctness
- `inspectTextTruncation(...)` for accidental clipping or overflow
- `inspectSemanticOverlaps(...)` for sibling-control collision checks
- snapshot signature tests for locked visual baselines
- layout signature tests for page-level semantic layout baselines
- `ShadcnGeometryParityTest` (`samples/ui-showcase:desktopTest`) for automated layout geometry parity (width, height, content padding, position offsets) against official shadcn reference rects
- `ShadcnStyleParityTest` (`samples/ui-showcase:desktopTest`) for automated computed style color & border parity (borderRadius, borderWidth, computed background/foreground tokens) against official shadcn reference styles
- `ShadcnBehaviorParityTest` (`samples/ui-showcase:desktopTest`) for automated interactive behavior, click activation, state toggling, space-key activation, menu item selection, and dialog dismissal
- `ShadcnParityScreenshotTest` (`samples/ui-showcase`) for pixel-baseline parity against the
  shadcn reference — `./gradlew :samples:ui-showcase:desktopTest --tests
  "*ShadcnParityScreenshotTest*"`. Regenerate goldens with `-DAWAKE_RECORD_SNAPSHOTS=true`
  only after inspecting the recorded diff PNG confirms the drift is an intended change, never
  blind. That test is a regression lock against Awake's *own* prior render, not a fidelity
  check against real shadcn/ui — for that, see "Shadcn Reference Fidelity Harness" below
  (`ShadcnReferenceComparisonTest`, `tools/capture_shadcn_reference.py`,
  `tools/compare_parity.py`)
- the `RendererHeadlessPixelBaselineTest`-style pattern (`awake:backend:vulkan:desktopTest`)
  for headlessly rendering a real frame and dumping it as a PNG when no live window/browser is
  available — the go-to for "does this actually render right" questions on 3D/backend work
- `UiShowcaseLayoutCostTest` (`samples/ui-showcase:desktopTest`) for frame-cost/perf
  regressions — measures real trial-measure pass counts and wall-clock time, not estimates
- the throwaway-probe-test idiom: build the real widget/scene through `renderUiComponent` (or a
  raw `UiContext` only when exercising the Core/runtime or renderer layer itself) and read its
  actual `UiBounds`/pixels, instead of reasoning about spacing,
  centering, or collapse behavior from source alone. This is the highest-leverage tool in this
  list — used to settle real "is X actually centered/tighter/regressed" questions with numbers
  instead of guesses (see `RowCrossAxisCenterProbeTest`, `UiShowcaseSidebarGapProbeTest`,
  `TypographyPaddingProbeTest` for the pattern). Keep the probe as permanent regression
  coverage when it proves something worth locking in, delete it when it was purely diagnostic
- `UiAnimationFrameCapture` (`awake:backend:vulkan:desktopTest`,
  `io.github.ronjunevaldoz.awake.vulkan.UiAnimationFrameCapture`) for "does this animation
  actually render right, frame by frame, through the real backend" questions -- the gap none of
  the tools above can close: a throwaway `UiBounds` probe (like the one above) proves the
  *logical* sequence is smooth, but never asks a renderer to draw anything, so it structurally
  cannot see a render-backend artifact (frame-pacing/dirty-rect lag between computed clip
  bounds and what actually gets presented). Builds the same real headless Vulkan renderer
  `RendererHeadlessUiGlyphBaselineTest` uses (`Renderer.renderUiToTexture`, backed by real
  `ui_quad`/`ui_rounded_quad`/`ui_glyph` pipelines against an `OffscreenRenderTarget`, not the
  CPU rasterizer `saveAwakeUiPreview`/`AwakeUiPreviewScene` use), drives a real animated
  `UiContext` scene for N real frames, and writes each frame as a numbered PNG for direct
  visual/pixel inspection. See `ShadcnCollapsibleRealRenderCollapseFrameCaptureTest`
  (`awake:backend:vulkan:desktopTest`) for the pattern -- real `shadcnSidebar`/
  `shadcnCollapsible` driven through a real collapse, 20 real rendered frames dumped and
  inspected for a jump/snap the logical-bounds probes couldn't have caught. Texture-backed
  primitives (render-target composites, e.g. a minimap) aren't supported yet -- add an
  offscreen texture-quad pipeline the same way `ensureOffscreenQuadPipeline` was added if a
  captured animation ever needs one

## Investigating "Extra Space" Reports

A real miss this session: a sidebar spacing complaint was investigated three times (layout
bounds, paint-level rendering, typography line-height) and all three came back clean, because
every investigation was framed as "did this change relative to before" — a regression diff.
The actual cause was two `spacer()` calls that existed unchanged both before and after the
change under investigation, so a before/after diff correctly reported them as identical and
moved on. "Unchanged" is not the same as "correct" — a spacer that was always too generous is
invisible to regression framing no matter how many times you re-measure it.

When investigating a spacing/layout complaint, do both, not just the first:

1. **Regression check** — did this specific change alter the spacing? (before/after `UiBounds`
   diff, the throwaway-probe idiom above.)
2. **Absolute check** — is the spacing *right*, independent of whether it changed? Grep the
   affected file for hardcoded `spacer(...)`/`padding(...)`/fixed `height(...)` literals near
   the reported area — cheap, and catches exactly this class of longstanding-but-still-wrong
   gap. Compare the absolute dp value against the shadcn reference (`third_party/shadcn-ui-ref/`,
   a pinned checkout -- run `tools/fetch_shadcn_reference.sh` if it's missing, see
   [docs/reference/shadcn-reference-pipeline.md](/Users/ronvaldoz/StudioProjects/awaken/docs/reference/shadcn-reference-pipeline.md))
   or the token scale (`ShadcnSpacing`/`UiSpacing`) it should be using instead of a hardcoded
   literal.

## Default-Behavior Changes In Hot Paths Need A Performance Check, Not Just A Correctness Check

Real incident: a correctness fix (making `surface()` clip content to its own rounded shape,
previously opt-in and unused by any real caller) changed a *default* — from "never runs" to
"runs for virtually every rounded surface" — inside `performDrawUi`'s per-primitive staging
loop, a genuine hot path. It shipped with full correctness proof (pixel-baseline diffs, a
targeted regression test) and zero performance proof. The result: every glyph inside every
rounded surface started paying Sutherland-Hodgman polygon clipping against a 29-point contour,
every frame, regardless of whether it was anywhere near a corner — a measured ~7.7x cost
increase on a real page. This shipped clean (tests green, no visual drift) and surfaced later
only as a vague, hard-to-pin-down "still lagging" report, chased through multiple dead-end
investigations before landing on the actual commit.

The rule: any change that flips a *default* (opt-in → always-on, or the reverse) inside code
that runs **per-primitive or per-frame** — draw-call staging, clip resolution, animation
stepping, layout measurement — needs a before/after performance measurement using this
project's own frame-cost tooling (`UiShowcaseLayoutCostTest`, `RendererHeadlessFrameTimingTest`,
or a direct microbenchmark of the changed function against a realistic input size) *before* it
ships, not after a lag report forces someone to go find it. Pixel-baseline tests catch "does
this look the same" — they cannot catch "does this now cost 8x as much to look the same."
`docs/reference/agent-catalog.md`'s render-backend/perf-owning agents should treat this as a
required step alongside pixel-diff review for any change matching that shape, the same way
`ShadcnParityScreenshotTest` is already a required step for anything touching rendered output.

A hardcoded spacing literal sitting next to a token-driven layout (`Arrangement.spacedBy(...)`)
is itself a signal worth flagging even before measuring anything — it's the kind of thing that
accumulates unnoticed specifically because it never shows up in a diff.

## Allowed Exceptions

Exceptions must be explicit in the test, not implicit in the UI:

- intentional truncation must be allowlisted by semantic id
- intentional overlap must be checked in a targeted overlap rule
- intentionally empty semantics are allowed only for non-interactive pure-decoration previews

If an exception is real, encode it in the validation config so the next regression stays loud.

## Required Commands

For shared UI work, run the smallest relevant verification task before considering the work
done:

```bash
./gradlew :awake:ui:testing:commonTest
./gradlew :awake:ui:headless:desktopTest
./gradlew :samples:ui-showcase:desktopTest
```

Add module-specific tasks when the change lives outside those surfaces.

## Placement Rule

Put long-lived policy here in `docs/reference/ui-validation.md`.

Keep only a short reminder in:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `.claude/AGENTS.md`
- repo-local UI quality skills

The rule should stay canonical in docs, not get copied into every agent entrypoint.

## Definition Of Done

A shared UI change is done only when:

1. the relevant preview/snapshot exists
2. validation is automated and green
3. the docs/gallery artifact can be regenerated from tests
4. any intentional exception is encoded in test config
5. a human can open the generated report and confirm the result without discovering new obvious breakage

## Shadcn Reference Fidelity Harness

`ShadcnParityScreenshotTest` (above) is a regression lock: it diffs Awake's render against
Awake's *own* previously recorded golden. That proves nothing changed by accident, but it
cannot tell you whether Awake actually looks like real shadcn/ui -- and, until this harness
existed, nothing automated ever checked. This closes that gap with a real upstream reference.

**Read this first: there are two oracles now, and they answer different questions.**

| oracle | test | answers | reaches 0 mismatch? |
|---|---|---|---|
| geometry | `ShadcnGeometryParityTest` | is the size/position right, to sub-pixel precision | yes -- badge and button are already within ~1px |
| pixel diff | `ShadcnReferenceComparisonTest` | does it look catastrophically wrong (colour/radius/border/shadow) | no, never -- two different rasterizers cannot produce identical anti-aliased pixels, structurally |

Geometry is the primary oracle for layout questions (padding, width, spacing, alignment) as of
2026-08-15. It compares Awake's semantic bounds against the reference app's own
`getBoundingClientRect` numbers -- both sides state their geometry exactly, so there is no
tolerance to tune and no rasterizer/font/anti-aliasing dependency. Three real bugs were found
*in* the pixel instrument before this existed (a mis-framed reference scored as a fidelity
number, an unset reference font, a reference rendering every weight as 400) against one real
bug found *by* it (badge's padding, in one pass, once the instrument itself was fixed) -- that
ratio is why pixel diff is no longer where a layout question gets decided. See
`ShadcnReferenceComparisonTest`'s class doc for the detailed account.

What geometry cannot see: fill colour, border colour, shadow, opacity. No oracle for those
exists yet -- a computed-style comparison (sampling `getComputedStyle` the same way the capture
already samples `getBoundingClientRect`) is the natural next piece, not yet built. Until it
exists, pixel diff is the only signal for that dimension and should be trusted for it,
distrusted for layout.

### Component coverage matrix

"Parity" is not one number. It is four independent dimensions, and a component is not "done"
until all four have an oracle AND that oracle passes. Update this table in the same commit
that adds or changes any of the four -- a stale matrix is worse than none.

**Corrected 2026-08-17.** The previous version of this section claimed 100% on layout,
style, AND behavior, with a per-component detail table underneath that contradicted it --
every row in that detail table read "no oracle" for style and behavior. Neither table was
right. Verified against the actual test files in
`samples/ui-showcase/src/desktopTest/kotlin/.../ui/`:

| dimension | oracle file | exists? | real coverage |
|---|---|---|---|
| **layout** (size, position, spacing) | `ShadcnGeometryParityTest` | yes | see file -- component-by-component sub-pixel table, largely current |
| **style** (fill/border colour, radius, shadow) | `ShadcnStyleParityTest` | yes | **23 of 23** components, one assertion function per component, real `getComputedStyle` oracle via `tools/capture_shadcn_local.py` -- but **light theme, rest state only**: no dark-theme case and no hover/pressed/focus variant anywhere in the file, matching the capture tool's own documented limitation (`capture_shadcn_local.py`: "focus/disabled/hover were uncapturable") |
| **behavior** (click, keyboard, focus ring, hover, disabled) | `ShadcnBehaviorParityTest` | yes | **5 of 23** components only: button (click + space-key), switch, checkbox, dropdown-menu, dialog. No focus-ring or hover assertions anywhere in the file |
| **motion** (transition, easing) | none, and captures actively disable animation | no | 0% |

**Coverage, counted against every distinct component with a parity preview** (23, deduplicating
`@AwakeUiPreview` ids in `ShadcnParityScreenshotTest` by name, e.g. `awake-toggle-matrix-light`
and `awake-toggle-button-variants-light` are the same component sampled two ways): alert,
avatar, badge, breadcrumb, button, checkbox, collapsible, dialog, dropdown-menu, kbd, popover,
progress, radio-group, select, skeleton, slider, spinner, switch, tabs, textarea, textfield
(input), toggle-button, tooltip.

| dimension | components covered | % of 23 |
|---|---|---|
| layout | see `ShadcnGeometryParityTest`'s own per-component notes | not re-derived here -- re-count from the file, don't trust a cached percentage |
| style | 23, light theme + rest state only (no dark theme, no hover/pressed/focus variant) | **100% of rest-state light coverage**, 0% of interactive/dark |
| behavior | 5 (button, switch, checkbox, dropdown-menu, dialog) | **~22%** |
| motion | 0 | **0%** |

**Real gap, not just doc drift:** 18 of 23 components have zero click/keyboard/dismiss
assertion. Closing it means writing `ShadcnBehaviorParityTest` cases for the rest of the
catalog, not fixing a stale number. The doc lesson: the two tables above disagreed with
each other for at least a week before this correction, and neither was checked against
the actual test files in the interim -- verify against `grep -c "fun .*MatchesShadcn"` on
these files before trusting a percentage in here again.

| component | layout | style | behavior | motion | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| badge | sub-px (+0.02..+0.30px), light+dark | rest, light | no oracle | no oracle | verified across light and dark themes |
| button | sub-px (+0.14..+1.78px), light+dark | rest, light | click+key oracle | no oracle | verified across light and dark themes |
| checkbox | sub-px (<=1.0px) | rest, light | click oracle | no oracle | |
| switch | sub-px (<=1.0px) | rest, light | click oracle | no oracle | |
| textfield (input) | sub-px (<=1.0px) | rest, light | no oracle | no oracle | |
| tabs | sub-px (<=2.5px) | rest, light | no oracle | no oracle | track's allowance is wider -- accumulates both triggers' text-advance rounding |
| select | sub-px (<=1.0px) | rest, light | no oracle | no oracle | |
| radio-group | sub-px (indicators <=0.00px, text <=6.5px) | rest, light | no oracle | no oracle | tagged `data-parity-id`, indicators sub-px exact |
| progress | sub-px (<=1.0px) | rest, light | no oracle | no oracle | tagged `data-parity-id` |
| dialog | sub-px (width/X/button <=0.83px, height <=6.0px) | rest, light | dismiss oracle | no oracle | tagged `data-parity-id`, text wrapping line-height allowance |
| tooltip | sub-px (<=1.5px) | rest, light | no oracle | no oracle | tagged `data-parity-id` |
| slider | sub-px (width/X <=0.00px, height <=14.0px) | rest, light | no oracle | no oracle | tagged `data-parity-id`, Radix 6px track vs Awake 20dp knob height allowance |
| alert | sub-px (width <=0.00px, height <=25.0px) | rest, light | no oracle | no oracle | tagged `data-parity-id`, padding allowance |
| avatar | sub-px (<=1.0px) | rest, light | no oracle | no oracle | tagged `data-parity-id` |
| breadcrumb | sub-px (<=76.0px) | rest, light | no oracle | no oracle | tagged `data-parity-id`, inline trail advance allowance |
| collapsible | sub-px (<=2.0px) | rest, light | no oracle | no oracle | tagged `data-parity-id` |
| kbd | sub-px (<=5.0px) | rest, light | no oracle | no oracle | tagged `data-parity-id`, Roboto font advance allowance |
| skeleton | sub-px (<=1.0px) | rest, light | no oracle | no oracle | tagged `data-parity-id` |
| spinner | sub-px (<=1.0px) | rest, light | no oracle | no oracle | tagged `data-parity-id` |
| textarea | sub-px (<=1.0px) | rest, light | no oracle | no oracle | tagged `data-parity-id` |
| toggle-button | sub-px (<=1.0px) | rest, light | no oracle | no oracle | tagged `data-parity-id` |
| dropdown-menu | sub-px (<=110.0px) | rest, light | select oracle | no oracle | tagged `data-parity-id`, item text-width allowance |
| popover | sub-px (<=10.0px) | rest, light | no oracle | no oracle | tagged `data-parity-id` |

Note: `docs/reference/shadcn-previews-local/card-login_light.png` and its Awake pair
(`card-local-light` in `tools/shadcn_parity_pairs.json`) are compared for pixel diff but "card"
has no standalone `@AwakeUiPreview` entry of its own in `ShadcnParityScreenshotTest` under this
naming scheme, so it is not counted as one of the 23 -- flagged here rather than silently
dropped; reconcile when card gets tagged for a geometry oracle.

All 23 components have tagged geometry captures and active sub-pixel assertions in
`ShadcnGeometryParityTest`, and rest-state light-theme style assertions in
`ShadcnStyleParityTest`. 5 have a behavior assertion. Read each row's own notes column;
this table is the source of truth, the two summary tables above it are derived from it and
can go stale independently -- if they ever disagree with this table again, this table wins.

Adding a component's layout row: tag the reference app's JSX with `data-parity-id` matching
Awake's semantic ids (see `tools/shadcn-reference-app/src/cases.tsx`'s badge/button/checkbox/
switch/input/tabs/select cases for the pattern), re-capture with
`python3 tools/capture_shadcn_local.py --only <case> --theme light`, add one
`assertGeometry(...)` call in `ShadcnGeometryParityTest` naming an `allowancePx` you can
justify, then update this table. Style, behavior and motion columns cannot be filled in yet --
no oracle exists for them.

- `tools/capture_shadcn_reference.py` -- renders real shadcn/ui components straight from
  `ui.shadcn.com`'s own docs pages (Playwright, headless Chromium, fixed 1280x800 viewport,
  devicePixelRatio 1, forced light theme, animations/transitions/caret disabled via injected
  CSS) and saves them to `docs/reference/shadcn-previews/`. Verified byte-identical across
  repeated runs. Re-capture with:
  ```bash
  python3 -c "import playwright" || (pip3 install playwright pillow && python3 -m playwright install chromium)
  python3 tools/capture_shadcn_reference.py            # all components
  python3 tools/capture_shadcn_reference.py --only button,card   # a subset, while iterating
  ```
  Each `capture_*` function names the exact `data-slot` selector(s) it depends on -- if
  `ui.shadcn.com`'s own markup drifts enough to break one, that's where to look first.
- `tools/compare_parity.py` -- given an Awake preview PNG and a shadcn reference PNG, trims
  each image's own uniform-color border independently, compares the two at their intersection
  size (top-left anchored, since the two are never pixel-identical in layout), and reports
  mismatch %, max channel delta, mean delta, plus a red/blue diff heatmap PNG.
  `python3 tools/compare_parity.py --all` runs every pair listed in
  `tools/shadcn_parity_pairs.json` (the single source of truth for which Awake preview id pairs
  with which reference filename).
- `ShadcnReferenceComparisonTest` (`samples/ui-showcase`) -- the same aligned-crop comparison,
  reimplemented in Kotlin against `java.awt.image`/`ImageIO` so it runs in the normal Gradle
  suite with no Python/Playwright dependency at test time:
  `./gradlew :samples:ui-showcase:desktopTest --tests "*ShadcnReferenceComparisonTest*"`.
  Renders its own Awake-side previews (doesn't depend on `ShadcnParityScreenshotTest` having
  run first), writes `build/reports/shadcn-parity-metrics.json` plus one diff heatmap per pair
  under `build/reports/shadcn-parity/`, and prints a summary table. Absolute mismatch against
  the real upstream reference is expected and stays untargeted -- pixel-perfect parity with
  shadcn/ui isn't the goal -- but *drift* is gated, see below.
- `tools/compare_component_crops.py` for component-level parity when a page preview contains
  several widgets. The reference side is cropped automatically by
  `tools/capture_shadcn_local.py` using the reference app's `#case`/portal selector; the Awake
  side is cropped by semantic node ID from the generated preview JSON. This is the canonical
  way to compare a component inside a larger showcase without manually cropping screenshots.

Caveat carried over from `docs/reference/shadcn-parity.md`: shadcn/ui has no single canonical
look (style presets, base colors, density all vary) -- these captures are *a* real reference,
not *the* one true pixel target. The previous `docs/reference/shadcn-previews/*.png` set
(hand-captured 2026-07-19) was never actually from `ui.shadcn.com` despite being described that
way -- it was captured from `shadcn-compose`, a third-party Kotlin reimplementation (evidence:
the old `select_closed_light.png` showed the literal text "Vega", `shadcn-compose`'s own style
preset name, not a real shadcn select demo's option text). This harness fixes that by going
straight to the upstream demo pages.

### Shadcn Parity Regression Gate

This is the pixel side's regression mechanics, unchanged by the geometry oracle above --
it still catches "got worse," it is just no longer where "is this right" gets decided for
layout. Skip to the component coverage matrix above for which oracle owns which question.

`ShadcnReferenceComparisonTest` used to be deliberately non-failing -- its own header said it
"only asserts the harness itself ran and produced a report a human can open." That gap was not
theoretical: the checkbox component regressed to a 8dp corner radius on a 16dp box (a visible
circle, not a checkbox), `checkbox-local-light` is one of the 12 pairs the harness already
compared every run, and the test still passed because nothing ever read the number it wrote.

The fix is a committed baseline, not a fidelity target. `tools/shadcn_parity_baseline.json`
records each pair's mismatch% as of the last time a maintainer looked at its diff PNG and
accepted it. The test now fails if a pair's current mismatch% exceeds its recorded value by
more than `tolerancePct` (1.0 percentage point). Getting *worse* than shadcn/ui fails the
build; staying exactly as far from shadcn/ui as before does not -- absolute distance from the
reference is untouched policy, only regression is gated.

**Tolerance, from evidence, not a guess.** Four back-to-back runs of the comparison on
unchanged code produced byte-identical `shadcn-parity-metrics.json` output (0.00 percentage
points of drift) -- this harness has no measured run-to-run noise on one machine/JVM, because
it renders through Awake's own deterministic CPU rasterizer, not a live browser. 1.0pp is
headroom above that measured-zero floor for cross-machine/JDK/font-rendering variance across
CI runners, not a response to observed flakiness. A real regression dwarfs it: temporarily
forcing the checked checkbox's fill to bright red (`AwakeCheckboxStatesLightPreview`'s
`style = Style { background(Color(1f, 0f, 0f)) }`, a color-only override applied entirely from
the test file, no `commonMain` edit) moved `checkbox-local-light` from 26.32% to 30.77% -- a
4.45pp jump, over 4x the tolerance, and the gate failed with exactly that message. Reverting
the override returned the number to exactly 26.32% and the gate passed again. (A `shape(8f.dp)`
corner-radius override -- the closer analog to the shipped circle-checkbox incident -- was
tried first and produced *zero* measured change, not because of a harness blind spot but
because 8dp already *is* the default preset's `theme.radii.md` -- `ShadcnRadiusScale.fromBase`
computes `md = baseRadius - 2`, and the default `Vega` preset's `baseRadius` is 10dp, so the
"perturbation" was a no-op that happened to match production exactly. Switched to a color
override, which changes pixels the radius token doesn't touch.)

**Same record convention as everywhere else** (`ShadcnParityScreenshotTest`,
`UiShowcasePreviewDocsTest`): `-DAWAKE_RECORD_SNAPSHOTS=true` overwrites
`tools/shadcn_parity_baseline.json` with the current run's numbers instead of gating. Follow
`skills/awake-ui-verification/SKILL.md`'s re-recording discipline -- run without recording
first, read `build/reports/shadcn-parity/<name>_diff.png`, explain the drift, only then record.

**Not every pair is gated.** A pair whose aligned crop doesn't cover most of its own content
measures framing, not fidelity (see `generate_parity_report.py`'s `crop` column:
`good` >=75% of the Awake render's own area was compared, `partial` >=35%, `poor` below that).
`tools/shadcn_parity_baseline.json`'s `excluded` map holds pairs deliberately left out, each
with a stated reason -- currently just `slider-local-light`, whose reference PNG
(`docs/reference/shadcn-previews-local/slider-states_light.png`) is itself only 6px tall before
any Awake-side cropping runs (the capture never included the slider thumb -- a
`tools/capture_shadcn_local.py`/reference-app issue, not an Awake or alignment problem). It
still renders and appears in the report, just isn't compared against a baseline. `tabs-local-
light` and `card-local-light` were previously `partial`/borderline; `tabs-local-light` stayed
un-gated-by-exclusion but its full-canvas ratio (0.744) undercounts a mostly-fine crop (its
own trimmed-content ratio is ~95%, the shortfall is deliberate preview margin, not
misalignment) and is gated anyway. `card-local-light` and the tooltip pair were fixed instead
of excluded: the card preview had drifted to compare content the reference never showed (an
extra password field, a footer-slot divider absent from the real login-card demo), and the
tooltip pair was comparing a button trigger against the reference's tooltip-bubble capture --
a wrong-content pairing, not an alignment problem. Both are `good` crops now.
