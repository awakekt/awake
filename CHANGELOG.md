## [Unreleased]

### Known issues

- **`UiContext.measuring` is dead** — declared, read by click-suppression guards, never
  set true. A wrap-content trigger's content lambda runs unsuppressed during trial
  passes as a result. Not yet reproduced as an actual swallowed click (see
  `ShadcnPopoverCheckboxClickProbeTest`); full investigation in commit `7c3f54ba`.

- **A wrap-height `shadcnToggleGroup` creates a 100,000px hit rectangle.** Its internal
  `fillMaxHeight()` resolves against the trial-measurement sentinel, so a viewport header pushes
  the rail offscreen and then intercepts the popup's clamped-on-screen menu clicks. It is not an
  active/focus claim failure or the nesting defect fixed in `d3f270c7`. **Blocks the viewport
  header**, and matters anywhere a wrap-height toggle group can overlap a popup. Diagnosis and
  the required regression shape are in `docs/tasks/2026-08-11-studio-layout-design.md`.

- **Glyph stem weight varies with sub-pixel phase.** The same character repeated on one line
  renders 1px and 2px stems in alternation (`'i' @14px: [1,1,1,2,1,2,1,2,...]`), which reads as
  "some characters thin, some not". MTSDF was expected to close this and did not: the field
  resolves an edge analytically, but each quad still lands at a different sub-pixel phase as
  fractional advances accumulate. Recorded as `knownStemWidthSpread = 1` in
  `GlyphStemWeightTest` -- which is currently `@Ignore`d, because its probe cannot isolate
  individual stems (a repeated 'i' at 12px collapses into one run at every threshold tried).
  Disabled deliberately rather than left green and lying. **Top open issue.**
- **Studio shows no custom cursor.** `SceneGameRuntime` has the cursor in its frame effects
  and discards it, unlike `GameUiRuntime`, and no service registration exposes the runtime to
  an entry point. `runVulkanDesktopGame`'s `cursor` defaults to null, so every request is
  dropped.
- **Studio does not use the engine's camera system.** `awake:scene:controls` provides
  `CameraMode` (FirstPerson, ThirdPerson, Cinematic, TopDown) with `CameraInputSystem`
  handling drag and scroll per mode, and `scene3d-playground` uses it. Studio defines a
  parallel `CameraPresetMode` (Orbit, Front, Top) with hand-rolled preset math and drag that
  only responds in Orbit, so Cinematic and TopDown are unreachable from studio and the
  viewport is not draggable in the other modes.
- **The resizable handle's geometry does not match upstream shadcn.** Real shadcn is a `w-px`
  in-flow Separator whose grab area is an absolutely positioned pseudo-element, plus
  react-resizable-panels' `hitAreaMargins`. Splitting ours into a 1dp layout cost and a
  separate grab margin was tried and reverted: it re-proportioned every panel, and because it
  required hit-testing outside `interact()` it killed the hover state the resize cursor reads.
  Closing this needs `interact()` to accept a hit rect distinct from its layout rect.
- **`docs/reference/ui-status.md` is stale** — it predates the MTSDF and resizable work.
- **Studio viewport canvas padding is wrong.** Reported, not yet diagnosed.
- **Studio's tool rail is inert.** All five buttons (Layers, Grid, Environment, History, Panels)
  dispatch `SelectTool` and update the store, and `activeTool` is then read only by `IconRail`
  itself to decide which button looks pressed. Nothing else reads it. Its PLACEMENT is fine --
  Blender and Unity both float tools at the viewport edge -- the wiring is what is missing. See
  `docs/tasks/2026-08-11-studio-layout-audit.md`.
- **Studio entity selection is inert.** `InspectorState.selectedEntityId` is written by the store
  and read by nothing; `InspectorPanel` lists every named entity regardless. There is no UI to
  select from, which is what the hierarchy dock is for.
- **`StudioShellLayoutTest.panelsDockFlushToEveryFrameEdge` fails.** Pre-existing, confirmed
  against clean `main` with all local changes stashed. Never diagnosed.

## [0.1.0-dev.6] - 2026-08-23

Rendering-architecture pass, plus the ECS and UI work that accumulated since dev.4 (this branch
never carried the dev.5 tag, which was cut on `vulkan`).

The theme is removing decisions that were being made twice. Pipeline construction moved behind a
shared description with a per-backend factory; `GpuDevice` gave the Vulkan/WebGPU boundary a name
and a rule; and the WebGPU backend became executable on the desktop JVM, so it is testable
outside a browser for the first time. Alongside that: ECS tag storage and a reflection-free
component-mutation path, UI frame-allocation cuts, and continued shadcn parity work.

### Added

- The WebGPU backend now runs on the desktop JVM as a **test target**, and creates a real GPU
  device there. WebGPU code was previously compile-checked and never executed outside a browser.
  Production is unaffected — desktop and Android still ship Vulkan. Note this exercises Awake's
  WebGPU code path over wgpu-native, not a browser's WebGPU implementation, so canvas sizing, JS
  interop and browser driver behaviour still need a browser check.
- `GpuDevice`, the named render-hardware-interface boundary: what a GPU backend can do, with no
  knowledge of what a scene is. `Renderer` extends it. No behavioural change — see
  `docs/reference/render-hardware-interface.md`.
- WebGPU now builds the alpha-blended transparent pipeline companion Vulkan already had, so
  a `DrawCall.transparent` draw blends on both backends instead of silently rendering opaque
  on WebGPU. A format with no transparent companion still falls back to its opaque pipeline.
- A reflection-free cached-`ComponentTypeId` mutation path for ECS add/remove operations.
  Matched JDK 17 measurements improved component churn by 16.9% at 10k and 22.1% at
  100k, while 100k maintained-family churn allocation fell by roughly 90%.
- A benchmark-only pure-archetype ECS control that performs real row migration and a
  256-signature fragmentation suite. Matched JDK 17 measurements keep production Awake on
  sparse sets plus maintained families: stable/query iteration stayed faster and dynamic-tag
  churn avoided archetype migration's roughly 7.6x throughput penalty at 100k entities.
- `EcsTag`, structured storage diagnostics, and payload-free singleton storage across both
  component stores and maintained `Family1`/`Family2` caches. Tag family iteration keeps one
  singleton reference; the existing `components*()` APIs lazily materialize compatibility arrays.
- `shadcnTabs`' `items`/`selected` overload takes a `content: ColumnScope.(String) -> Unit`
  slot, rendering a real content panel below the track instead of modeling the track only.
  Defaults to empty, so existing track-only callers are unaffected.
- `ShadcnSurfaceVariant.Band` — a full-bleed chrome strip (muted, square-cornered,
  horizontal-only inset), for an app toolbar/status-bar row rather than a panel/card.
  `shadcnSurface` also takes an optional `contentPadding: Dp?` override.
- `popup()`/`dialog()` (`ui-headless`) and all 9 designsystem overlay wrappers built on them
  (`shadcnDropdownMenu`, `shadcnTooltip`, `shadcnAlertDialog`, `shadcnContextMenu`,
  `shadcnSheet`, `shadcnDrawer`, `shadcnDialog`, …) take a `modifier: Modifier` param.
  `widthIn(max=)`/`heightIn(max=)` now actually clamp the popup's resolved size — the
  underlying primitive already supported it, the facades just never forwarded it.
- `samples:ui-showcase`/`samples:studio` are now covered by `verifyUiOwnership`, banning
  direct `ui-core` (`ui.modifier.*`) imports and hand-authored `Style { }` blocks in consumer
  code — the same rule that already applied to `ui-designsystem`.
- GPU-based 3D Camera System: a single `CameraComponent` carrying a `CameraMode` enum
  (`FirstPerson`, `ThirdPerson`, `Cinematic`, `TopDown`) plus an `ActiveCamera` tag
  component. One `CameraSystem` drives every mode and only processes entities tagged with
  `ActiveCamera`, preventing input drift in inactive modes.
- `CameraInputSystem`: Handles hotkey switching (F1-F4) between camera modes.
- `MatrixRelativeMovementSystem`: Dynamically transforms movement intents from
  `MovementControl` based on the active camera's orientation, ensuring view-relative WASD.
- `PlayerInputSystem`: Simplified hardware-to-ECS intent mapping for kinematic movement.
- `Vec3` math helpers: `set`, `lerp`, and `add` for easier mutation.
- `awake-ecs` and `awake-scene` as publishable artifacts. `awake-ecs` is now the pure
  sparse-set ECS runtime; Awake-specific scene components and systems moved to
  `awake-scene`.
- Maintained ECS family handles for one- and two-component queries, including
  component-only iteration for systems that do not need entity handles.
- GPU skinning: `Quat` (`awake-base` `core.math`), `GltfSkinning.kt` (skin/animation data
  types) and `SkinnedAnimationPlayer` (a generic glTF animation sampler) in `awake-base`
  `core.mesh.gltf`, `VertexFormat.PositionNormalColorSkin`, and
  `Renderer.drawSkinnedMesh(mesh, material, model, jointPalette)` — a separate staged-draw
  path from `draw()`/`DrawCall` because a skinned mesh's vertex layout doesn't match the
  one shared main 3D pipeline. `Renderer.createMaterial(...)` gained a `uniformFloatCount`
  parameter so a skinned material's joint-palette uniform buffer can be sized correctly.
- Texture sampling: `Bitmap.toRgba8Bytes()` (`awake-base` `core.graphics.BitmapRgba8.kt`),
  materials/textures/images parsing on `GltfDocument`/`GltfParser`/`GltfMesh`
  (`GltfMesh.baseColorImageBytes`, `toInterleavedPositionNormalColorUv()`),
  `VertexFormat.PositionNormalColorUv`, and `Renderer.drawTexturedMesh(mesh, material,
  model)` — same separate staged-draw pattern as GPU skinning.
- `:awake:scene:scene-core` gained `SpinControl`/`SpinSystem` (generic entity rotation) and
  `:awake:scene:controls` gained `LookAtControl`/`LookAtCameraSystem` (rotation-only
  tracking) plus `PrimaryOrbitCamera` (a plain lifecycle helper, not an ECS `System`, for
  a UI-driven debug camera entity) — extracted from boilerplate duplicated across
  `samples:scene3d-playground` demos.
- `Mesh.format` and `DrawCall.extraUniformFloats` — a `MeshRenderer` entity's mesh now
  determines which GPU pipeline draws it (`Renderer.pipelinesByFormat` on the Vulkan
  backend), instead of `RenderSystem`/`draw()` only ever supporting one fixed vertex
  format. `:awake:scene:rendering` gained `SkinnedPose`, an optional `MeshRenderer`
  add-on component carrying a GPU-skinned mesh's joint palette. `OrbitCameraDemoRig`
  gained a public `entity` accessor so a demo can attach these to its placement entity.

- Real-time shadow mapping for the directional scene light: a depth pre-pass renders
  shadow casters from the light's point of view into a `ShadowMap`, and the lit pipeline
  compares against it with manual PCF (this repo's `VkSamplerCreateInfo` binding has no
  `compareEnable`/`compareOp`, so hardware Dref sampling isn't available). Runtime-gated by
  `Renderer.shadowsEnabled`.
- `Renderer.wireframe` mesh view mode. Vulkan uses a `VK_POLYGON_MODE_LINE` companion
  pipeline sharing the fill pipeline's loaded shaders; WebGPU has no polygon-mode
  equivalent, so it derives a line-index buffer from the triangle indices and draws
  `LineList` topology instead.
- Web (wasmJs) bitmap decoding, via `createImageBitmap()` plus an offscreen-canvas
  readback. `Bitmap` creation became `suspend` across all four platform actuals as a
  result — decoding in the browser is inherently asynchronous.
- A build gate (`verifyShaderBinaries`) that fails `check` when a GLSL source drifts from
  its checked-in `.spv`. Vulkan loads the compiled binaries at runtime, never the adjacent
  sources, so a stale binary silently ignores shader edits — this was found the hard way
  after 7 of 10 checked-in binaries turned out to already be stale.

### Removed

- 8 dead-public designsystem style functions narrowed to `internal`: `shadcnAvatarStyle`,
  `shadcnAvatarBadgeStyle`, `shadcnToggleGroupItemStyle`, `shadcnRadioStyle`,
  `shadcnProgressStyle`, `shadcnSkeletonStyle`, `shadcnSpinnerStyle`, `shadcnToastStyle`. Zero
  real callers existed outside their own module.
- Legacy camera systems and controllers: `OrbitCameraController`, `OrbitCameraSystem`,
  `FollowCameraSystem`, `LookAtCameraSystem`, and `FreeFlyCameraSystem`.
- `PlayerControlSystem` and legacy control components (`OrbitControl`, `FreeFlyControl`,
  `FollowControl`, `LookAtControl`).
- `Renderer.drawSkinnedMesh`/`drawTexturedMesh` — the separate staged-draw bypass a skinned
  or textured mesh needed before `RenderSystem`/`draw()` supported more than one vertex
  format. `GltfViewerDemo`/`SkinnedMeshDemo` (`samples:scene3d-playground`) now spawn a real
  `MeshRenderer` entity (plus `SkinnedPose` for the skinned case) instead.
- `DemoApplication`'s per-second `Random.nextInt` drawable switching on desktop. Leftover
  debug code that silently overrode `DemoDrawer`'s real click-to-select mechanism — selecting
  an item in the drawer never stuck for more than a second. Not a feature; just noise.
- `VulkanApplication.glfwWindowHandle` field. Replaced by a real `expect fun createSurface`/
  `destroySurfaceWindow` pair in `awake-vulkan` (see `awake-vulkan/src/*/kotlin/io/github/
  ronjunevaldoz/awake/vulkan/VulkanSurface.kt`) — the field existed only to let `destroy()`
  know whether to call GLFW teardown; now `destroySurfaceWindow()` is called unconditionally
  and is simply a no-op on Android, so there's nothing left to track.
- `buildSrc`'s hand-rolled `signing-publication-conventions.gradle.kts` (`maven-publish` +
  `signing` applied and configured by hand, including a manual sign-task-dependency
  workaround). Replaced by the vanniktech `maven-publish` plugin applied directly in
  `awake-core/build.gradle.kts` — see "Changed" below for why it isn't a shared buildSrc
  convention plugin anymore.

### Changed

- Pipeline construction is described once and built per backend. `PipelineSpec`, `PipelineKey`,
  `PipelineRequest`, `PipelineSet`, `PipelineVariant` and `buildPipelineTable` moved into
  `render:contract`; each backend now implements a one-method `PipelineFactory` that only
  translates an already-decided description into its own API. Previously each backend decided
  independently which pipelines exist, which is how WebGPU came to lack a transparent pipeline
  that Vulkan had.
- UI frame allocation cut 56% (1,151,016 → 507,357 bytes on a 20-row/60-surface scene), and it
  scales linearly with page size again rather than superlinearly. Five fixes, all aimed at work
  that trial measurement passes repeat and then discard: trial contexts read weight answers
  through to the real context instead of copying them; ambient locals copy store-to-store instead
  of through a snapshot object; a trial no longer tessellates clip shapes whose primitives it
  will drop; `Style.resolve` walks its rules by index instead of building two filtered lists; and
  `Modifier` is one shared empty instance with identity-guarded `width`/`height`. `ui-core`'s new
  `UiFrameAllocationProbe` measures this and holds a ceiling that ratchets down as further
  allocation fixes land.
- Kotlin upgraded to 2.4.10, the latest stable bug-fix release. ECS family internals are split
  into focused membership/cache/value-column files with documented tag and payload strategies.
- `awake-ecs` `System` is now scheduler-free: the stale `frequency` property and
  `SystemFrequency` enum were removed from the public ECS core API. Scene scheduling now
  belongs to `awake-scene`/`awake-scene-dsl` registration via `SceneSystemPhase` plus
  explicit fixed-step and per-frame system helpers.
- `awake-scene` now keeps only the small `NavMesh` contract; the demo navmesh bootstrap,
  hardcoded demo geometry, recast4j dependencies, and proof tests moved to
  `samples:scene3d-playground`. `SceneRuntime` is deprecated in favor of
  `SceneGameRuntime`/`sceneGame {}`.
- Authored gameplay systems `ChaseAiSystem` and `PlayerMovementSystem` moved out of
  published `awake-scene` and into `samples:scene3d-playground`. Engine-owned systems should
  be reusable behavior; sample/game-specific systems belong with the authored gameplay that
  owns their rules.
- Scene internals started splitting behind the published `awake-scene` facade:
  `:awake:scene:scene-core` now owns `Transform`/`Name`, and `:awake:scene:rendering` owns
  `Camera`/`Light`/`MeshRenderer` plus `RenderSystem`. `:awake:scene:physics` now owns
  `PhysicsBody`/`PhysicsSystem`, `:awake:scene:controls` now owns
  `OrbitControl`/`FreeFlyControl`/`FollowControl`/`MovementControl` plus their camera
  systems, and `:awake:scene:runtime` now owns `SceneGameRuntime`, `SceneGameSpec`, the
  scene document model, and `SceneAssetLibrary`. `TransformSystem` moved to
  `:awake:scene:scene-core`; `PlayerControlSystem` moved into `:awake:scene-dsl` (it needs
  `ui-core`). `:awake:scene-dsl` now depends on the specific scene leaf modules it uses
  instead of the whole `:awake:scene` facade. Public package names stay stable.
- **Maven Central publishing migrated off Sonatype's legacy OSSRH staging API**
  (`s01.oss.sonatype.org`), which Sonatype sunset in June 2025 — publishing would have failed
  outright had it been run. Now uses the vanniktech `maven-publish` plugin targeting the
  current Central Portal (`./gradlew :awake-core:publishToMavenCentral -PisMainHost=true`).
  Credential property names changed accordingly: `ossrhUsername`/`ossrhPassword` →
  `mavenCentralUsername`/`mavenCentralPassword` (now a Central Portal user token, not a
  Sonatype JIRA account), `signing.keyId`/`signing.secretKey`/`signing.password` →
  `signingInMemoryKeyId`/`signingInMemoryKey`/`signingInMemoryKeyPassword`. CI's
  `.github/workflows/build-and-publish.yml` JDK bumped 11 → 17 to match `jvmToolchain(17)`.
- `awake-demo/desktopApp/src/jvmMain/kotlin/main.kt`'s `fun main()` now launches the real
  Compose UI (`application { Window { MainView() } }`) again — it had been commented out in
  favor of a raw OpenGL/AWT `createFrame` loop, which meant `:awake-demo:desktopApp:run`
  never actually showed the Compose demo (buttons, Enable-Vulkan switch, FPS text) on any
  renderer. That OpenGL loop is preserved as `runOpenGlFrameDemo()` — a plain function, not
  currently wired to a Gradle task — since it's still a legitimate manual smoke test, just no
  longer what `run` should launch by default.
- `VulkanApplication.createSurface()` no longer branches on `window is Long` to distinguish
  Android's `Surface` from desktop's GLFW window handle — it delegates to the new
  `expect fun createSurface` in `awake-vulkan` instead. Behavior is unchanged; this is a
  structural cleanup (see Phase 1c in `docs/mvp-plan.md` for the full rationale).
- `awake-ecs` component stores now use primitive sparse/dense arrays instead of
  `MutableList` storage, reducing structural add/remove overhead in the benchmark harness.
- Glyph coverage-alpha now gets stem darkening (`pow(alpha, 1/1.45)`) on both backends.
  `SwapchainManager` deliberately picks a `_UNORM` (not `_SRGB`) format because authored
  colors are already sRGB-encoded bytes, which means all alpha blending happens on
  gamma-encoded values and text rendered visibly too thin. Darkening the stems is what
  FreeType/Skia do when linear blending isn't available.
- Icon centering offsets snap to whole pixels, matching what text already did via
  `resolveGlyphPx`. An odd width difference otherwise landed a whole glyph on a
  half-pixel, blurring every edge.
- Shadow lookups use a slope-scaled bias (`max(0.0090 * (1 - dot(N,L)), 0.0015)`) instead
  of one constant. A single constant can't serve both face-on and grazing surfaces: large
  enough to stop grazing-angle acne means detaching face-on contact shadows.
- `VulkanGameApplication` takes one `additionalPipelines: Map<VertexFormat, GameShaderSet>`
  instead of paired `skinnedShaderSet`/`skinnedVertexFormat`/`texturedShaderSet`/
  `texturedVertexFormat` parameters, so adding a fourth vertex format no longer means
  adding a fifth and sixth constructor parameter.
- `VulkanGameApplication` no longer builds a whole `Material` purely to borrow its
  descriptor-set layout — a half-constructed instance that `createResources` had to never
  be called on, and that teardown had to partially destroy. `Material.createDescriptorSetLayout`
  is now a companion function and only the layout handle is held.
- Dark-theme `card` and `sidebar` colors corrected to oklch lightness 0.205, matching the
  published shadcn spec (they were 0.168 and 0.158).
- `UiContext.column`/`row` (member) and `UiPrimitiveScope.column`/`row` (extension) — the
  raw-slot forms that take an already-resolved `Rectangle` — renamed to `columnAt`/`rowAt`.
  They shared a name with the unrelated "smart" `column`/`row` family that resolves its own
  slot from id/style/arrangement, an overload-resolution trap. Root-authoring
  `UiContext.column`/`row` (resolves its own slot from a `Modifier`) is unaffected.
- `ui-headless`'s own `Modifier` type (`HeadlessModifier`, plus ~14 duplicate builder
  functions) is gone. `Modifier` and its builders (`width`, `padding`, `clickable`, etc.) are
  now `ui-core`'s real `UiModifier`, re-exported through `ui-headless` for `ui-designsystem`'s
  benefit — behaviorally identical, but any code importing
  `io.github.ronjunevaldoz.awake.ui.headless.Modifier` directly by fully-qualified name (rare)
  should re-check that the symbol still resolves; the star/named import form is unaffected.
- `ShapePainter.kt`'s widget-chrome helpers move from `UiPrimitiveScope` extensions to
  `CanvasScope` extensions and are renamed to match: `emitFillAndBorder` → `drawFillAndBorder`,
  `emitCheckmark` → `drawCheckmark`, `emitRadioDot` → `drawRadioDot`, `emitInsetDash` →
  `drawInsetDash`. They now take resolved `Color` params instead of reading theme defaults
  internally — `CanvasScope` never touches theme, matching how Compose's `DrawScope` works.
  `CanvasScope.context` is fully removed, no longer just relocated.
- `UiPrimitiveScope.emit`/`emitOverlay` are gone — `CanvasScope` (via `canvas { }`) is now the
  only way to submit a draw primitive. Code drawing straight from `UiPrimitiveScope` needs to
  move behind `canvas { }`, same shape as `ShapePainter.kt`'s widget-chrome helpers above.
  `UiPrimitiveScope.context` is unaffected — still there, real usage outside `ui-core`'s draw
  path is much larger and out of scope for this pass.
- `canvas()`'s `id` param is now required (its default was dead — zero real callers used it).
  `separator()`'s `id` is now required on both overloads, including the deprecated `color:`
  bridge — closes a real same-id collision risk the old nullable-last default carried.
- `Modifier.margin()` is deleted. It silently dropped `end`/`bottom` and had zero real callers;
  use `Modifier.padding()`/explicit `width`/`height`/`offset` instead.
- `shadcnIcon`, `shadcnRadioGroup`'s content-slot overload, and `shadcnSidebarGroup`/
  `shadcnSidebarMenu`/`shadcnSidebarMenuSub` now return `Rectangle` instead of `Unit`, so they
  can anchor a popup or be composed into layout math like other recipes. Purely additive —
  existing callers that ignore the return value are unaffected.
- Claiming the same widget `id` twice in one frame now throws immediately instead of the two
  widgets silently sharing one state slot (hover/active/animation bleeding between them).
  Turning this on surfaced 3 real pre-existing collisions in `samples:studio` (a pill
  toolbar's separators, and two toolbar hairlines all defaulting to the same fallback id) —
  fixed alongside the check.

### Fixed

- Both backends leaked one pipeline per vertex format on teardown. Each enumerated its pipeline
  companions by hand in `destroyBackend` and each omitted the transparent one when it was added.
  `PipelineSet.all` now enumerates them, so a companion added later cannot be missed.
- `popup()`'s `id` is now required (headless facade + the underlying primitive). It used to
  default through `id ?: modifier.testTag ?: "popup"` — any popup with neither set silently
  shared one fade-animation state bucket with every other un-ided popup on screen. Fixed the
  same collision-by-default pattern in `shadcnAvatarBadge`, `shadcnAvatarGroup`,
  `shadcnFieldSeparator`, and `shadcnSidebarMenuSub`, whose defaulted `id`s fed a *different*
  child widget's required-id slot.
- A `FillMax`-width `interactiveSurface()`/`button()` (any content-lambda form, not just the
  headless label form) with no explicit width could never resolve a hover-conditional
  `Style` — `surfaceCore` built its interactive style from a placeholder `hovered = false`
  computed before any real slot existed, then never recomputed it once the real slot (and a
  real hit test) existed. `resolveInteractiveSurface`'s headless path never had this bug; it
  now shares the same claim-then-hit-test-then-resolve order. Same fix ports package 5's
  wrap-content/`FillMax` intrinsic-width exception into `surfaceCore`, which had only ever
  reached the headless-only button path.

## [0.1.0-dev.5] - 2026-08-18

UI-core cleanup and correctness pass: dead deprecated-API surface removed, the style-merge
channel collapsed toward `Style` alone, wrap-content+fillMax layout unlocked (button groups
now size and round corners correctly), and a cross-platform input-drop bug fixed at its
shared root instead of per-backend.

### Fixed

- A pointer down+up pair landing within one frame interval (fast taps, synthetic/automation
  clicks) could have its down edge silently erased by the up event, on every platform --
  fixed once in the shared `Input` class rather than per input bridge.
- `shadcnAlertDialog`'s buttons rendered unstyled and never reported which one was pressed.
- `shadcnDrawer`/`shadcnDialog` set `showScrim = true` but never `scrimColor`, so their
  scrim silently never drew.
- Two tooltips in one frame shared one state bucket (a default `id` on a stateful widget),
  causing visible frame-to-frame instability.
- A vertical button group filled its enclosing frame instead of wrapping to its content,
  and members had no per-corner rounding. Fixed at the root: a wrap-content parent now sees
  a `FillMax` child's real intrinsic size during measurement instead of a placeholder.

### Changed

- `UiContext`'s 31-member deprecated mirror layer removed (821 -> 648 lines); ~55 external
  call sites migrated to their real API.
- ~330 lines of dead headless composites and ui-core publics removed.
- Every headless/design-system widget now resolves its visible properties through `Style`
  alone -- no remaining ambient/ex-ambient theme fallback.

## [0.1.0-dev.4] - 2026-08-11

UI correctness and the first piece of the studio layout redesign. Ships the general fix for a
bug class that had produced three separate shipped defects.

### Fixed

- **Widget-state writes made during a measuring pass are dropped.** `column()` re-executes its
  content against a scratch context sharing the real, persisted `WidgetState` but with blank
  input, so anything writing state from that pass corrupted what the real pass read moments
  later in the same frame. It had shipped three times: the resizable handle's drag anchor was
  deleted every frame so dragging did nothing, `animatedHeight` kept a stale height across a
  collapse, and a popup nested one container deeper would not open. The first two were fixed
  per-widget, which left every other stateful widget exposed. Guarding `UiStateValue`'s setter
  covers every hook at once, so a new widget cannot reintroduce it by forgetting to guard itself.
- **Studio's display toggles moved to a viewport-edge pill.** Wireframe and shadows sat in the
  top bar, which was a scoping error -- they govern how one viewport draws, not the document.
  Kept out of the tool rail deliberately: that rail is modal, these are independent booleans.
- **`popup()` honours `Modifier.widthIn()`/`heightIn()`**, so `max-w-*` is expressible for
  popup-based components instead of hard-coded. `maxWidth` applies before measurement as well as
  after, so wrapped content reflows within the cap rather than being clipped.

### Added

- Studio layout audit, target design and an SVG wireframe --
  `docs/tasks/2026-08-11-studio-layout-audit.md`, `-design.md` and `-layout.svg`. The audit found
  three inert controls; the design maps every region to components that already exist and
  sequences the work in independently shippable phases.

## [0.1.0-dev.3] - 2026-08-11

Font rendering: the atlas moved to MTSDF and the verification gaps that let font bugs ship were
closed. Text rendering is NOT finished at this tag -- stem weight still varies with sub-pixel
phase, tracked under Unreleased / Known issues.

### Fixed

- **`rasterize()`'s missing-font placeholder is no longer glyph-shaped.** It drew a filled rect
  in the glyph's own colour, inset 25%, which reads as a blob of text and -- worse -- measures as
  one: probes scanning for ink found placeholder geometry and reported it as glyph metrics. That
  produced a confident but wrong "glyphs render at 0.6x their metrics" investigation and left two
  font gates green while they measured placeholders. Now a solid magenta box over the glyph's
  full bounds, so neither a reader nor a pixel measurement can mistake it for text, and the
  `font` parameter documents that it is required whenever a frame contains glyphs.

- **Glyph ink rendered at ~0.90x of its own metrics** (sub-pixel at 12-14px, past a pixel from
  16px up): the font-atlas generator sized render quads to the glyph outline but UV rects to
  outline + crop bleed + a texel snap, squeezing the padded atlas region into an outline-sized
  quad. Quads are now derived from the snapped sample rect (quad and UV cover the same texels
  1:1) and outline-true `inkMetricsEm` ships separately so `capHeightEm`/baseline/advance
  metrics stay ink-exact. The per-glyph snap slack was also what scattered baselines; the
  Chromium baseline-fidelity drift map is re-measured with an honest probe (transparent
  background, alpha-channel coverage, degenerate-run guard) and every text-bearing snapshot
  signature is re-recorded. `GlyphAbsoluteSizeTest` now gates absolute ink size against
  `capHeightEm * size` -- the external-truth check this repo never had.

  Verified on screen by Ron June Valdoz, 2026-08-11. That confirms this fix specifically, not
  text rendering overall -- stem weight still varies with sub-pixel phase, see Known issues.

## [1.0.0-SNAPSHOT] - not released

Placeholder retained from the Keep a Changelog template. It was never filled in, which is why
every entry above accumulated in Unreleased instead of being cut into a section at tag time --
`v0.1.0-dev.1` through `dev.3` all shipped without one. Sections are cut at tag time from here
on.

### TODO

- [ ] Render triangle via Vulkan (Android, iOS, Desktop)
- [ ] To improve game loop
- [ ] Implement Fixed & Variable timestep
- [ ] Create ECS (Entity, Component, System)
- [ ] Create renderer that can draw single and batch instance
- [ ] Model instancing to provide faster rendering for batch models
- [ ] Animation instancing to provide faster rendering for batch model with animations
- [ ] UI Text, etc. (similar to compose-ui??)
- [ ] Physics Networking (low priority)

### Changes

- Improve vulkan struct to java vice-versa converter

### Added

- Vulkan Android support.
- Initial support for Android, iOS, and desktop OpenGL.
- Implemented using Compose Multiplatform for increased flexibility.
- Experimental high-quality text rendering (TTF).
- GlslValidator plugin for pre-compiling glsl to spv in the demo project.

### Known Issues

- Possible memory leak when using Vulkan.
- Incomplete text rendering.
- Desktop OpenGL texture rendering is leaking.
