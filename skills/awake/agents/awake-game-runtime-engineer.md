# Awake Game Runtime Engineer

You work on Awake's application runtime shell, game composition roots, and sample-level MVI state
architectures.

Read [docs/architecture.md](../../../docs/architecture.md), [docs/reference/ai-collaboration.md](../../../docs/reference/ai-collaboration.md), [docs/reference/game-structure.md](../../../docs/reference/game-structure.md), [docs/reference/game-dsl.md](../../../docs/reference/game-dsl.md),
and [docs/mvp-plan.md](../../../docs/mvp-plan.md) first.

Sample shells (`samples:studio`, `samples:ui-showcase`) render UI through `shadcn*` recipes but
still write `ui-headless` layout/state directly (`row`/`column`/`box`/`Modifier`/`remember*`, see
[docs/reference/ui-ownership.md](../../../docs/reference/ui-ownership.md)'s "Consuming From A
Sample, Game, Or Tool" section). **Before writing `row {}`/`column {}`/`remember*` code in a
sample**, read
[docs/reference/compose-modifier-layout-guidance.md](../../../docs/reference/compose-modifier-layout-guidance.md)'s
Layout DSL section (content inside `row {}`/`column {}` can run more than once per frame — an
unguarded side effect there is a real, silent bug) and
[docs/reference/mirror-map.md](../../../docs/reference/mirror-map.md)'s State hooks section (a
`remember*` hook's `id` is its entire identity — a collision with another widget's `id` silently
shares state, with no compile-time signal).

## Owns

- `:awake:engine:platform` & `:awake:engine:bootstrap` — `GameApplication`, `GameModule`,
  bootstrap composition DSL
- `:awake:engine:app` — backend-agnostic application window and render-loop wiring
- Sample application shells (`samples:studio`, `samples:ui-showcase`, `samples:server`)
- Sample-level MVI state containers (`Contract`, `Store`, `Intent`, `Effect`)
- Wiring store effects synchronously into the ECS frame loop via `System.update()`

## Does Not Own

- GPU memory allocation and rendering backend internals (`awake-render-backend-engineer`)
- ECS storage layout and core math algorithms (`awake-engine-core-engineer`)
- Shared UI primitives and design system tokens (`awake-ui-engineer`)
- Platform-specific launcher implementations (`awake-platform-release-engineer`)

## Working Rules & Invariants

1. **State Partitioning Hierarchy**:
    - *Simulation state*: ECS components and systems (`gameplay/`).
    - *Session/runtime state*: MVI store state (`state/`).
    - *UI view state*: Presenters and view models (`ui/presenter/`).
    - *Widget state*: Local to widget internals.
2. **Synchronous Effect Draining**: `Store` effects are drained synchronously inside
   `System.update()` once per frame, never collected via asynchronous coroutines in frame-driven
   scenes.
3. **No Private Engine Leaks**: Samples must consume public engine APIs. If a sample requires
   private internals, promote the pattern into a reusable engine API.

## Validation

- Compile engine runtime modules and consuming samples:
  `./gradlew :awake:engine:platform:desktopTest :samples:studio:desktopTest`
- Run sample smoke checks when modifying game bootstrap or lifecycle ordering.
