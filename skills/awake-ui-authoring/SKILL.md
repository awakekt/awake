# Authoring UI in Awake

Three layers, each with one job. Putting code in the wrong one is the single most common
defect in this stack, and it fails *silently* -- the UI still renders, it just renders someone
else's design language.

| Layer | Owns | Never contains |
|---|---|---|
| `ui-core` | Geometry, layout, slots, drawing, anchoring, clipping, input/state mechanics, and neutral CompositionLocal-like theme/text mechanics | Any widget recipe, variant, or brand name |
| `ui-headless` | Widget **behaviour**, structure, and application of caller-supplied generic `Style` | Any named design-language vocabulary, theme-provider API, or branded visual policy |
| `ui-designsystem` | The shadcn **look** -- named themes, sizes, colours, radii, variants, and component styles | Behaviour that another skin would also need |

Decide with one question: **"would a differently-skinned product still need this code?"** Yes ->
`ui-headless`. No -> `ui-designsystem`.

## The size rule (this is the one that bites)

> A `ui-headless` widget may only fall back to a size it can derive from **its own content**,
> **its own font/vector metrics**, or a **physical constraint** (1 device pixel). Any size it
> cannot derive must be supplied as neutral widget visual/layout data by the caller above it.

Not "no defaults". Defaults are mandatory here -- this is an immediate-mode UI with a single
measure pass, so a widget with no intrinsic size measures to **zero** and silently draws
nothing. The question is never *whether* to have a fallback, only whether it is derivable.

`textarea()` is the reference implementation: its height is
`fontHeight * minLines + lineGap + contentPadding` -- no magic numbers, scales with the font,
correct under any theme. Copy that shape.

### Why this matters more than it looks

A Material-flavoured `40.dp` button fallback sat in `ui-headless`. Nothing overrode it, so it
became the de-facto default -- and then it propagated **upward**: `ShadcnButtonSize.Md` was set
to `40f` to match, and shadcn's real button is `h-9` = **36px**. The comment in
`ShadcnAvatars.kt` says the quiet part out loud -- the avatar size was chosen to match "this
module's pre-existing 40dp default", not to match shadcn (`size-8` = 32px).

An headless default is not a neutral placeholder. It becomes the spec.

Do not add a `UiComponentStyles` registry to `ui-core`. A per-component size/recipe registry is
visual policy and inevitably turns Core into a hidden design system. Headless may accept a
generic visual-state contract; `ui-designsystem` supplies the actual branded sizes, colours, and
radii by mapping its named variant to that neutral contract. A Headless fallback must remain
content-derived, metric-derived, or a physical constraint.

## Units: authored values are `Dp`, never raw pixels

Widget code lives in density-independent units. A raw `Float` added to a pixel-space coordinate
renders half-size on a 2x display and looks fine on the machine that wrote it.

```kotlin
// Wrong -- physical pixels, does not scale
private const val LABEL_GAP = 8f
x += LABEL_GAP

// Right -- authored in Dp, converted at the point of use
private val LABEL_GAP = 8f.dp
x += LABEL_GAP.toPx()
```

If surrounding arithmetic is genuinely px-based, still source the value from a `Dp` and convert
at use. `awake.ui-authored-units-convention` is meant to police this; do not rely on it alone.

### The inverse trap: pixels wrapped as Dp (applies to SAMPLES too, not just widgets)

A value computed from a slot (`slot.height - bar.toPx()`) is **pixels**. Wrapping it `.dp`
re-multiplies by `UiDensity.scale` at resolve time -- 2x on every Retina display, invisible on
the density-1 machine (and every density-1 test) that wrote it. Studio shipped exactly this:
`Modifier.height(workspaceHeightPx.dp)` doubled the workspace at scale 2 and pushed the dock
handle and status bar off-frame, which read as "the resizable is broken".

- Slot-derived or otherwise pixel-valued numbers go back into modifiers via `.px`
  (`Float.px` divides by the scale), never `.dp`.
- This rule is layer-independent: sample shells violate it as easily as widgets.
- A pre-commit grep for `[a-zA-Z]Px\.dp\b` catches the naming-convention cases mechanically.
- Any layout suite guarding a live shell needs at least one case at `UiDensity.scale = 2` --
  at scale 1 the whole bug class is definitionally invisible
  (`StudioShellLayoutTest.workspaceStaysInsideTheShellAtRetinaDensity` is the model).

## Bound-derived interiors must not report intrinsic size

A widget whose interior layout is `fraction x its own resolved bound` (a resizable panel
group, a scroll viewport's content) has **no intrinsic size** -- yet inside a WrapContent
parent's measure trial its children's claims land at trial-inflated positions and register as
phantom content extent. The showcase's preview card grew by the drag delta every frame this
way: the group's handle claim at `fraction x trial-bound` out-measured the card's real text
content, and the re-measured card re-based the panel budget mid-gesture.

Wrap the real content dispatch of such widgets in `boundDerivedContent { ... }`
(`ui-core/scope/UiScopeNesting.kt` -- the stronger sibling of `compositeContent`, isolating
wrap-extent trackers, not just the child list). Scroll viewports already do the equivalent via
`withMeasuredSubtreeIsolated`. Symptom to recognize: "dragging/interacting inside a card
re-sizes the card itself".

## Fill the axis through `Modifier`, never `Dimension.FillMax`

`Dimension.FillMax` is a Core layout-resolution sentinel, not authored UI vocabulary. Public
Headless calls express intent with Compose-style modifiers:

```kotlin
Modifier.fillMaxWidth()
Modifier.fillMaxHeight()
Modifier.fillMaxSize()
```

Use `width(48.dp)` or `height(48.dp)` for a fixed authored dimension. Do not expose a public
`width(Dimension)` or `height(Dimension)` overload just to make `FillMax` available.

## Naming: Radix is canonical

Adopt the Compose name only where Compose and Radix agree, or where Radix has no concept.

Reasoning: there is no Compose here -- no `@Composable`, no recomposition, no androidx
`Modifier`. A Compose name promises a runtime this engine does not have. The behaviour-parity
target is Radix, so names should track the contract they are held to. In practice the two
conventions agree on nearly everything (Checkbox, Switch, Slider, Separator, Button, Card,
Dialog, Tabs), and where they differ the Compose name has been the one that was *wrong about
the behaviour*.

- `select()`, not `dropdown()` -- it returns a chosen value, it is not a menu.
- `progress()`, not `progressBar()` -- the latter is Android View-era.
- A file's name must match what it exports. A file called `BasicText.kt` that exports no
  `basicText()` is lying.
- Styled counterparts are `shadcn<Widget>` over the same base name, so the base names must
  *be* the shadcn names for the pairing to read.

For anything Radix has no name for, the Awake name wins -- `*Slot` overloads are an Awake
invention and a good one; keep them consistent.

## Behaviour belongs underneath, even when only one skin exists today

If a component owns real structure -- measurement, selection resolution, open/close state,
traversal -- that behaviour belongs in `ui-headless` even if `ui-designsystem` is its only
current caller. Several components (Tabs, Collapsible, Dialog, DropdownMenu) were built
styled-first and now own behaviour that cannot be reused or reskinned without dragging shadcn
in. That is a debt, not a pattern to copy.

The exception is genuine *composition*: a branded arrangement of existing primitives with no new
behaviour is correctly design-system-only.

## Headless consumes `Style`, not a theme recipe

Runtime-free theme value contracts live in `ui-api`; `ui-core` owns their runtime locals and
the neutral `CoreUiTheme` fallback. Headless does not reach into `UiContext` or `Local*` stacks
itself and does not expose `provideTheme`/`provideTextStyle`; it consumes Core's scope-level
accessors and generic `Style` values (and slots where appropriate), then applies the interaction
state supplied by that style.

`ui-designsystem` maps `Primary`, `Ghost`, or a shadcn preset to component `Style` factories.
Stateful details such as rest, hover, pressed, and disabled live beside that component's design
system style, not in a Headless visual DTO. `Style` is the only Headless visual contract.

Expose branded composition through a lower-case design-system extension such as
`fun UiScope.shadcnTheme(...)`. It delegates to Core's neutral providers and establishes the
ambient values that shadcn recipes read. Do not add `ShadcnTheme` or other branded APIs to Core
or Headless.

Use `shadcnThemeValues(...)` when only immutable theme values are needed; it does not install a
composition scope. Every `shadcn*` recipe must execute inside `UiScope.shadcnTheme { ... }`.
There is no Core-theme fallback: a missing scope is an error, so metrics and branded roles can
never be silently reconstructed from a generic Core theme.

## Design System may use Core infrastructure, never Core widget primitives

`ui-designsystem` may have an **internal** (`implementation`) dependency on `ui-core` for
`Style`, theme/text providers, CompositionLocal mechanics, and runtime-free value adapters. It
must not expose Core types from its public API.

A design-system recipe still calls Headless widgets for behavior. It must not claim slots, draw,
hit-test, record semantics, or call Core layout/control primitives directly. If a recipe needs
that, extend Headless with the missing generic behavior or slot API; duplicated behavior is a
Headless API gap, not a reason to bypass it.

## One entry point per widget: `UiScope`, not one overload per scope

A widget gets ONE public function, on `UiScope`. Do not add a `ColumnScope`/`RowScope`/
`BoxScope`/`AbsoluteScope` overload of it.

`ui-core`'s `surface()` is the counter-example still in the tree -- six functions for one widget:

| overload | what it actually changes |
|---|---|
| `UiPrimitiveScope.surface` (public) | entry point |
| `UiPrimitiveScope.surface` (impl) | the real body |
| `ColumnScope.surface` | width defaults to `FillMax` |
| `RowScope.surface` | height defaults to `FillMax` |
| `AbsoluteScope.surface` | **nothing** -- `modifier = modifier` |
| `BoxScope.surface` | **nothing** -- `modifier = modifier` |

Two do literally nothing. The two that matter encode one rule -- "fill my cross axis by default"
-- which belongs on the scope (ask it for its main axis) rather than being spelled out once per
scope type. `ui-headless` and `ui-designsystem` already made this move; `ui-core` is the holdout.

Why this matters beyond tidiness: overload sets hide capability gaps. Resolution picks the most
specific receiver silently, so a scope that lacks the overload falls through to a base version
that quietly ignores what the caller asked for. That is the same failure mode as
`Modifier.verticalScroll` on `row()`/`box()` -- accepted, dropped, no error -- which cost a full
session to find. One function per widget makes an unsupported combination a compile error or an
explicit `error(...)`, not a silent no-op.

When a scope genuinely needs different behaviour, branch on data the scope exposes inside the one
function. Add an overload only when the signature itself must differ (different parameters, not
different defaults), and say why in a comment.

## Headless: no separate overload for a content shape -- compose it through the slot

`ui-headless` gets exactly ONE widget entry point, and it is the slot/content-lambda form. Do
not add a parallel headless overload that takes a `label: String` (or any other "convenience"
data shape) and independently resolves/draws that content itself:

```kotlin
// Wrong -- a second headless code path that resolves/draws the label on its own
fun UiScope.button(id: String, label: String, ...)

// Right -- headless has one entry point; the label is composed through its slot
button(id) { text("Save") }
```

`button()` currently still has three headless overloads (label, callback, slot) -- that is
existing debt, not a pattern to extend. Do not add a fourth. This is the same principle as "one
entry point per widget" above, one level down: it is not just the *scope* that must not fork,
the headless *content shape* must not fork either.

Why this is stricter than it looks: a `label:` overload has to independently resolve the exact
same style (weight, size, colour, intrinsic width) the slot path already resolves once via the
widget's real style-resolution machinery (`resolveInteractiveSurface`/`buttonSlotInternal` for
`button()`). Re-deriving it a second time for the label path drifts from the first the moment
either one changes -- caught in this repo only by a snapshot-signature pixel diff (label text
rendered visibly smaller than the slot path), not by any type check or unit test, after a
same-session attempt to route the label overload through the slot API silently regressed font
resolution. One content-shape, one resolution path, no drift possible.

### `shadcn*` MAY offer `label:` -- as long as it calls exactly one headless component

The restriction above is on `ui-headless`, not on `ui-designsystem`. A `shadcn*` recipe is
allowed a `label: String` convenience parameter -- callers of a design system expect that
sugar -- but its OWN body must still be built on the single headless slot component, composing
the label through it, never by calling a headless label-shaped overload:

```kotlin
// Correct: shadcnButton(label = ...) is fine -- as long as internally it is
fun UiScope.shadcnButton(id: String, label: String, ...): Boolean =
    button(id, style = ...) { shadcnText(label, centered = true) }   // one headless component: button's slot

// Wrong: reaching for headless's label overload just because one exists
fun UiScope.shadcnButton(id: String, label: String, ...): Boolean =
    button(id, label = label, style = ...)   // second headless entry point, drifts from the slot path
```

The point of both rules together: every `shadcn*` component maps to exactly ONE headless
component, called exactly ONE way (its slot). That is what keeps a shadcn recipe's visual
result guaranteed identical to what its headless primitive actually resolves -- the label-vs-
slot font-resolution drift above happened because two different code paths existed to resolve
the same style; collapsing to one path per layer is what prevents it from recurring.

### The exception, found by trying it

A per-scope default is NOT always collapsible, because **overload resolution is static and a
`when (this)` is not**. `surface`'s `ColumnScope`/`RowScope` pair defaults the caller's cross axis
to `FillMax`. A call whose receiver is typed `UiPrimitiveScope` deliberately gets no default even
when the runtime instance happens to be a `ColumnScope` -- so replacing the pair with one function
that inspects `this` hands a default to every such call site. Tried exactly that: `PanelTest`, both
signature matrices and the parity screenshots all moved.

So the rule is narrower than "one function per widget":

- an overload that only forwards (`modifier = modifier`) is dead -- delete it
- an overload whose default depends on the STATIC receiver has to stay
- either way the rule BODY is written once and called from each, never copy-pasted

Delete-and-run-the-suite is the check. If nothing moves, the overload was dead.

## The showcase catalog is the only catalog

`samples:ui-showcase` publishes one list -- `ShowcasePages` in `ShowcaseCatalog.kt`. The app
renders it and every preview/layout-signature fixture is derived from it. Do not maintain a
second list of preview entries in test code.

Three rules keep it honest:

1. **One file per page**, under `ui/pages/<category>/`. The page object owns its own metadata
   *and* its `hero`/`variants`/`states` renderers. A preview function with no page object is
   dead code, not a hidden feature.
2. **`showcasePageOrNull` returns null for an unknown id.** Never reintroduce a fallback to
   `ShowcasePages.first()`. The old fallback let five test fixtures fingerprint the
   Introduction page while claiming to cover Range Slider, State, Shimmer, and Field Demo --
   green tests, zero coverage.
3. **Preview size lives on the page** (`previewWidth`/`previewHeight`), not in a JVM
   annotation. Reading fixture metadata by reflection forces a skip on iOS and wasmJs, so the
   same test silently passes there without asserting anything.

A component shadcn ships that Awake cannot build yet gets a `showcasePlaceholder(...)` entry
naming the missing primitive, not silence.

## The 4 Closed Foundational Primitives Rule

In Awake, every single UI widget is an atomic composition of exactly 4 primitive categories:

1. **Visual Container**: `surface` is the **ONLY** painted rectangular container (background, border, shape, elevation, hover/pressed state). `interactiveSurface` is deprecated/eliminated -- use `surface` with `Modifier.clickable`.
2. **Spatial Layout Containers**: `row`, `column`, `box`, `spacer` are the **ONLY** spatial layout containers. They do not paint backgrounds; they only distribute bounds.
3. **Content Leaf Nodes**: `text` and `icon` are the **ONLY** leaf content primitives.
4. **Behavioral Modifiers**: `Modifier.clickable`, `padding`, `size`, `weight`, `align`, `alpha` are the **ONLY** way to attach behaviors.

Leaf widgets (`button`, `checkbox`, `switch`, `tabs`, `collapsible`, etc.) must **never** call raw canvas graphics emitters (`emitFillAndBorder`, `emitCheckmark`, `emitRadioDot`) or manually calculate coordinate layouts; they must compose from these 4 primitives.

### Jetpack Compose Naming & Callback Conventions

Headless and Design System components strictly follow standard Compose callback and state parameter conventions:
- `button`: `onClick: (() -> Unit)? = null`
- `toggle`, `checkbox`, `switch`: `checked: Boolean`, `onCheckedChange: (Boolean) -> Unit = {}`
- `radio`: `selected: Boolean`, `onClick: () -> Unit = {}`
- `textField`, `textarea`: `value: String`, `onValueChange: (String) -> Unit = {}`
- `slider`, `rangeSlider`: `value: Float`, `onValueChange: (Float) -> Unit = {}`
- `tabs`: `selected: Boolean`, `onClick: () -> Unit = {}`

## Checklist

- [ ] Would another skin need this code? If yes it is not design-system code.
- [ ] Every size in a Headless widget is content-derived, metric-derived, a physical minimum,
      or provided through a generic Headless visual/layout contract -- never Core's component
      style registry.
- [ ] No raw-pixel `Float` constants; authored values are `Dp`, converted at use.
- [ ] No decoration choice (border width, chosen semantic colour), named variant, or direct
      `UiContext`/`Local*` stack read in `ui-headless`.
- [ ] New visual state is represented by generic `Style` and implemented in that component's
      design-system style file, never by a parallel visual DTO.
- [ ] Name matches the Radix concept; file name matches what the file exports.
- [ ] New behaviour landed in `ui-headless`, not in the `shadcn*` wrapper.
- [ ] One public function on `UiScope` -- no per-scope overload that only changes a default.
- [ ] No new `ui-headless` `label:`/content-shape overload -- a text label is
      `widget(id) { text("...") }` through the existing slot, not a second resolution path.
      `shadcn*` may still expose `label:` as sugar, but its body must call that same slot.
- [ ] Built exclusively from the 4 Foundational Primitives (`surface`, `row`/`column`/`box`/`spacer`, `text`/`icon`, `Modifier.*`) -- no raw canvas emitters or `interactiveSurface`.
