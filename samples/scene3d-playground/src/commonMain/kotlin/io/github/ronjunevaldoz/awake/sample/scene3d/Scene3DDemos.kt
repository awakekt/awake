/** Menu entry + viewport/controls renderers for one entry in the 3D playground (see

 * content, and controls panel content all live together in that demo's own file under
 * `demos/`, so a demo's pieces change together instead of being scattered across a shared
 * god-file.
 *
 * [onActivate]/[onDeactivate]/[onUpdate] are this demo's real-ECS lifecycle, driven by
 * [scene3DPlaygroundModule]'s `update` block whenever [Scene3DPlaygroundState.activeDemoId]
 * changes -- a demo spawns its own [World] entities in [onActivate] and destroys exactly those
 * entities in [onDeactivate] so switching pages never leaves a previous demo's mesh lingering.
 * A demo with no 3D content of its own leaves all three as no-ops. */
