# Tools

Build-time and verification tooling. None of these run as part of a normal build — they
generate committed artifacts or produce reports, and you invoke them by hand.

## Asset generation

Both of these generate committed Kotlin source. Never hand-edit their output, and never
hand-author the data they produce — that is how the icon set ended up with every corner arc
flattened to line segments, and how the font atlas ended up with mismatched glyph metrics.

| Script | Generates | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `svg_to_ui_image_vector.py` | `UiImageVector` glyph data (e.g. `HeroIcons.kt`) | Preserves curves as real cubic Beziers, converts SVG arcs exactly, keeps nested `evenodd` subpaths as holes. Rejects what the engine cannot render (strokes, transforms, crossing subpaths). Run `--self-test` after editing. See `skills/awake-icon-authoring/SKILL.md`. |
| `generate_ui_font_atlas.py` | `RobotoRegularUiFontData.kt` (packed glyph atlas + metrics) | Rasterizes a TTF into a coverage atlas via PIL. Glyph offsets and advances must stay in the same coordinate space — mixing cell-relative offsets with pen-relative advances produces uneven letter spacing. |

```bash
python3 tools/svg_to_ui_image_vector.py icon.svg --name chevronDown --dp 16 --source "Heroicons chevron-down (20/solid)"
python3 tools/svg_to_ui_image_vector.py --self-test
```

## Font fidelity

`capture_font_reference.py` renders each sample in `font_samples_manifest.json` with the exact
TTF baked into `RobotoRegularUiFontData`, using Chromium as the control, and saves it to
`docs/reference/font-previews/`. `FontBaselineFidelityTest` renders the same sample through
Awake's atlas pipeline and compares per-glyph ink baselines.

It exists because atlas metrics alone could not say whether a glyph sitting a pixel low was
faithful to the typeface or introduced by us. The control answered it: real Roboto puts every
glyph on one baseline at 12, 14 and 16px, while our atlas splits round and flat glyphs by a
pixel at 12 and 14. That drift is recorded in the test's `knownBaselineDrift` map, so it cannot
widen unnoticed — the goal is an empty map.

```bash
python3 tools/capture_font_reference.py
./gradlew :awake:engine:ui:ui-headless:desktopTest --tests "*FontBaselineFidelityTest*"
```

## Shadcn parity

The chain that answers "does this actually look like shadcn?" rather than "did this change?".
Read `docs/reference/shadcn-reference-pipeline.md` first.

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `fetch_shadcn_reference.sh` | Clones `shadcn-ui/ui` at a pinned SHA into `third_party/` (gitignored). Everything below depends on it. |
| `extract_shadcn_tokens.py` | Parses the pinned registry's new-york/neutral theme into `ShadcnReferenceTokens.kt`, the numeric ground truth for token tests. |
| `capture_shadcn_local.py` | Builds and serves `shadcn-reference-app/`, then screenshots each case from `shadcn_reference_cases.json` into `docs/reference/shadcn-previews-local/`. Components come verbatim from the pinned checkout, so the reference is shadcn's own source. Captures states a docs page cannot show (focus, disabled, hover, open overlays) and any theme or radius. A case may name its own `selector` when Radix portals its content outside `#case`. |
| `compare_parity.py` | Diffs an Awake render against a reference capture: aligned crop, heatmap, mismatch metrics. Pairing lives in `shadcn_parity_pairs.json`. |
| `generate_parity_report.py` | Regenerates `docs/reference/shadcn-parity.md` from the component inventory, token test state, and comparison metrics. |
| `generate_ui_status.py` | Regenerates `docs/reference/ui-fidelity-status.md`, the per-area status matrix. Each row's status comes from a probe against the source, so it cannot claim done for unwired work. |
| `shadcn_parity_baseline.json` | Committed regression baseline consumed by `ShadcnReferenceComparisonTest.kt` (not a script) -- each pair's last-accepted mismatch%, an absolute-percentage-point tolerance, and an `excluded` map for pairs whose crop alignment can't be trusted yet. See `docs/reference/ui-validation.md`'s "Shadcn Parity Regression Gate" section. |

```bash
tools/fetch_shadcn_reference.sh
./gradlew :samples:ui-showcase:desktopTest --tests "*ShadcnReferenceComparisonTest*"
python3 tools/generate_parity_report.py
python3 tools/generate_ui_status.py
```

Comparison metrics are only as good as the alignment between the two captures. The generated
report carries a `crop` column for exactly this reason — a `poor` row means the framing
differs too much to conclude anything, not that the component is wrong.

`ShadcnReferenceComparisonTest` fails the build on regression (a pair's mismatch% drifting worse
than its `tools/shadcn_parity_baseline.json` entry by more than the baseline's tolerance), not on
absolute distance from shadcn/ui -- that distance is real and stays untargeted. Re-record the
baseline the same way as any other golden here, `-DAWAKE_RECORD_SNAPSHOTS=true`, only after
reading the diff PNG under `build/reports/shadcn-parity/` and confirming the drift is intended
(see `skills/awake-ui-verification/SKILL.md`).

## Icon fidelity

Proves each shipped `HeroIcons` `UiImageVector` renders the same shape as the official
Heroicons SVG it was generated from, automatically -- see `skills/awake-icon-authoring/SKILL.md`.

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `capture_heroicons_reference.py` | Downloads each icon's official SVG and rasterizes it to a fixed 128x128 reference PNG (white fill on black, playwright/chromium) under `docs/reference/icon-previews/`. |
| `heroicons_manifest.json` | The (name, tier, Kotlin symbol) list both this script and `IconFidelityTest` read -- one source of truth, keyed by (name, tier) since Heroicons ships different path data per tier for the same name (e.g. `square-3-stack-3d` in both 20/solid and 24/solid). |

```bash
python3 tools/capture_heroicons_reference.py                    # re-capture every reference
python3 tools/capture_heroicons_reference.py --only chevron-down,camera
./gradlew :awake:engine:ui:ui-headless:desktopTest --tests "*IconFidelityTest*"
```

`IconFidelityTest` (`awake/engine/ui/ui-headless/src/desktopTest/`) renders each icon through
the real CPU rasterizer at the same 128x128 size and compares coverage-mask IoU against the
reference (threshold and measured correct-vs-corrupted separation are documented on
`passThreshold` in the test). It writes a reference/ours/diff PNG per icon to
`build/reports/icon-fidelity/` and a `metrics.tsv` — always regenerate references after adding
or regenerating an icon in `HeroIcons.kt`, and add the new entry to `heroicons_manifest.json`.

Catches gross shape errors (wrong path data, a rotated/mirrored derivation, a flattened curve).
Does not catch sub-pixel drift -- both pipelines' antialiasing differs enough that IoU alone
can't distinguish a 1px edge nudge from noise; that is a known ceiling, not a gap this guard
silently papers over.

## Preview serving

`ui_preview_server.py` and `ui_preview_watch.sh` serve rendered preview PNGs for manual
review. They are a convenience for eyeballing, not a verification gate — see
`docs/reference/ui-validation.md` for what actually counts as proof.

## Other

`jni-binding-generator/` generates JNI bindings for the native backends and has its own
documentation.

## Detekt baselines

Every module's `detekt-baseline.xml` was regenerated on 2026-08-09 after the parallel
component wave (Resizable, Sheet, ScrollArea, Empty, Combobox, Table, studio camera mode)
and the accordion/slider/checkbox fixes. Everything absorbed is structural — MagicNumber on
graphics/geometry constants, LongMethod, LongParameterList, CyclomaticComplexMethod — and was
reviewed before absorbing: findings that pointed at real defects (dead code, unused
parameters, an unapplied modifier) were fixed in source, not baselined. detekt's baseline
parser rejects XML comments, so this record lives here rather than in the files themselves.

A new entry appearing in a baseline diff means new structural debt: prefer fixing it or a
commented `@Suppress` at the site; `./gradlew detektBaseline` is the deliberate second choice.
