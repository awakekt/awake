"""Instantiates the static Roboto faces Awake ships from the variable source.

google/fonts ships Roboto as a single variable font (ofl/roboto/Roboto[wdth,wght].ttf), so the
static faces the atlas generator consumes are derived here rather than downloaded separately. One
source version means a weight change is only a weight change -- mixing releases would make every
metric difference unattributable, the same reason capture_font_reference.py pins its own file.

The variable source lives in tools/ because it is build input, not a shipped resource.

Usage:
    python3 tools/instantiate_roboto.py

# draw 500 in Regular, which quietly put the whole parity comparison at the wrong weight.
